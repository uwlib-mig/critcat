    <dc:description>Coast Salish peoples are a diverse group of Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest who speak related languages and have some common cultural traditions. The Coast Salish grouping includes many different tribal groups, all with their own names for themselves and most with their own languages. Coast Salish peoples have lived in the Pacific Northwest since time immemorial and their traditional lands surround the Salish Sea, including part of the Olympic Peninsula, the coast of Puget Sound, the eastern side of Vancouver Island, and the southern coast of British Columbia. 

The Coast Salish peoples of the Puget Sound region were famous for their coiled and twined baskets. Some of the baskets were so tightly made that they could hold water. In this photo taken around 1900, a Coast Salish basketmaker holds a split cedar root in her mouth, ready to work it into her basket.

    <dc:description>The Makah people of the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula refer to themselves as Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx, which translates roughly to &quot;the people who live by the rocks and seagulls.&quot; The early Makah were skilled mariners, using several types of canoes which they carved from western red cedar for various purposes—war, whaling, fishing, sealing, carrying cargo, and long voyages. Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting. 

In this photo, a small Makah boy holds the oars of a large cedar canoe at Neah Bay. Makah children learned how to handle canoes at a young age. The Makah used their large canoes for long-distance travel, fishing, and for hunting whales.

These women are weaving the delicate wrapped twined baskets for which the Makah are well known. The baskets are made from cedar bark warps and grass wefts, some of which are dyed various colors. Most of the small &quot;trinket baskets&quot; as they were called had lids and were decorated with geometric and animal or bird designs.

The Makah people built large ocean-going canoes which they used for whale hunting and for voyages around Puget Sound. By 1900, when this photo was taken, Makah canoes shared the waters with many large steamships and sailing craft. This photo shows a Makah sailing canoe in the foreground and a large three-masted sailing ship behind.

The Makah used their large canoes for long-distance travel, fishing, and for hunting whales. In this photo, taken at Neah Bay, Makah men, women, and children pull their canoe up on the beach on rollers. This canoe also has a cloth sail which is furled in the bow of the canoe. Before European contact, the Makah used cedar bark sails on their canoes.

The Makah people of Washington's Olympic Peninsula hunted whales and other sea mammals from large seagoing canoes. The hunters harpooned the animals and kept them from sinking by attaching floats made from sealskin filled with air. This photo taken in 1900 shows a row of Makah canoes, probably at Neah Bay. The canoe in the foreground is filled with sealskin floats.

    <dc:description>From the late 1860s to the early 1890s, hop farming was an important activity in the valleys of the Puget Sound region, including Puyallup, White River, and Snoqualmie. Indigenous workers came from through the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska (but especially from regional tribes like the Puyallup, Snoqualmie, Muckleshoot, Duwamish, Sammamish, Lummi, and Nisqually) as a seasonal labor force to harvest these crops in last summer and early autumn.

These Indigenous workers gathered the cone-like fruit into handmade baskets, as shown in the photograph. Indigenous people used split cedar or spruce root to make this type of open-weave storage basket, traditionally used to store dried foods and household goods in the longhouses.

    <dc:description>The Makah people of the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula refer to themselves as Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx, which translates roughly to &quot;the people who live by the rocks and seagulls.&quot; The early Makah were skilled mariners, using several types of canoes which they carved from western red cedar for various purposes—war, whaling, fishing, sealing, carrying cargo, and long voyages. Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting. 

The Makah people of Washington's Olympic Peninsula hunted whales and other sea mammals from large seagoing canoes. The hunters harpooned the animals and kept them from sinking by attaching floats made from sealskin filled with air. These carved cedar dugouts traveled miles out into the open ocean for whale hunting as well as for fishing and trading trips. This image shows a group of hunters landing their canoe at Neah Bay.

    <dc:description>The Makah people of the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula refer to themselves as Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx, which translates roughly to &quot;the people who live by the rocks and seagulls.&quot; The early Makah were skilled mariners, using several types of canoes which they carved from western red cedar for various purposes—war, whaling, fishing, sealing, carrying cargo, and long voyages. Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting. 

The Makah people of Washington's Olympic Peninsula hunted whales and other sea mammals from large seagoing canoes. These carved cedar dugouts traveled miles out into the open ocean for whale hunting as well as for fishing and trading trips. This image shows a Makah whale hunter next to a canoe. The float inside the canoe is made from inflated sealskin and was attached to the harpoon line when it was thrust at the whale.

    <dc:title>Encampment of Indigenous people on Ballast Island at the Seattle waterfront, circa 1900</dc:title>

    <dc:description>In 1865 the Board of Trustees of Seattle passed Ordinance No. 5 banning Indigenous people from living in the city unless they worked for a non-Indigenous resident and lived on their employer’s property. Despite this attempt to enforce separation between Indigenous people and the settlers, Seattle depended on Indigenous people. Settlers relied on Native people for domestic work and for trade of fish, shellfish, and baskets. Indigenous people from across the Pacific Northwest also harvested hops in agricultural areas to the south and east of Seattle. 

Because they were excluded from the rest of the city, many Indigenous people stayed on Ballast Island, either when passing through, temporarily stopping, or living on the island year-round. Ballast Island was in the harbor at the foot of Washington Street and was created when sailing ships dumped their ballast in Elliott Bay in order to take on cargo. The only place close to Seattle’s business district where Indigenous people were allowed to live, Ballast Island lacked a source of fresh water or permanent structures. As the waterfront grew in the 1890s, Ballast Island was gradually covered and by the time the seawall was built in 1916, the island was almost completely gone and its Indigenous residents had again been displaced. 

This image shows part of the encampment on Ballast Island around 1900. The coastal Native peoples adopted canvas tents in place of their native cattail mat shelters for traveling.

    <dc:description>From the late 1860s to the early 1890s, hop farming was an important activity in the valleys of the Puget Sound region, including Puyallup, White River, and Snoqualmie. Indigenous workers came from throughout the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska (but especially from regional tribes like the Puyallup, Snoqualmie, Muckleshoot, Duwamish, Sammamish, Lummi, and Nisqually) as a seasonal labor force to harvest these crops in late summer and early autumn. Often, whole families would work together and on occasion entire villages were emptied as people left for the hops harvest. Workers would use downtime to socialize with each other, weave baskets to sell, or fish for salmon. 

These Indigenous workers gathered the cone-like fruit into handmade baskets, as shown in this photograph. Indigenous people used split cedar or spruce root to make this type of open-weave storage basket, traditionally used to store dried foods and household goods in the longhouses.

This portrait of a young woman identified as Tasha was taken inside a canvas tent, probably in a camp along the Seattle waterfront. She was most likely on her way to pick hops on farms to the south and east of the city. Hop picking was an important source of cash income for Indigenous people living in the Pacific Northwest during this time period.

    <dc:description>At the turn of 19th to 20th centuries, Indigenous artists in the Pacific Northwest were making baskets and carvings specifically for the tourist trade and were experimenting with form and design. Making baskets for sale became an import income source for many Indigenous families. In this photo, taken around 1911 outside a downtown Seattle store, a woman bends to ask a basket seller about her wares. The mats and baskets are Nuu-chah-nulth (formerly called Nootka) in style.

    <dc:description>The Quinault are a Coast Salish people whose historic territory was the southwestern Olympic Peninsula. The current Quinault Indian Nation (QIN) has a reservation covering part of their historic lands. In addition to Quinault people, the QIN includes people from several neighboring tribes: Queets, Quileutes, Hohs, Chehalis, Chinook, and Cowlitz. Fishing, especially for salmon, is an important part of Quinault culture. Salmon spawn on the Quinault and Ozette rivers. After the fish laid and fertilized their eggs, Quinault fishers use a wide array of nets or traps to catch them. Historically, the Quinault also hunted whales, seals, and sea lions. 

In this image taken near Moclips, a group of tourists watches a Quinault canoe paddle out from the shore. Starting in the early 20th century, oceanside resorts were established on the Pacific coast south of the Quinault reservation, where city residents could enjoy the healthy sea air and salt water.

    <dc:description>In 1855, representatives of the Indigenous peoples of the area now known as Seattle, including the Duwamish and Suquamish, signed the Treaty of Point Elliott. As part of this treaty, many Indigenous people agreed to move in their tribal groups to reservations outside of the Seattle area, but some remained. In 1865 the Board of Trustees of Seattle passed Ordinance No. 5 banning Indigenous people from living in the city unless they worked for a non-Indigenous resident and lived on their employer’s property. 

Hwehlchtid (called Salmon Bay Charlie by the settlers) of the Shilshole people lived on the southern shore of Salmon Bay, near present-day Ballard, which was then outside of Seattle. Hwehlchtid and his wife Chilohleet'sa (Madeline) remained in their traditional homeland long after others of their tribe had moved away. This photo, taken around 1905, shows their home at Shilshole with a canoe docked outside. Although the wood planks of the house were not hand-hewn as in older dwellings, the traditional smoke hole with its adjustable cover is visible.

    <dc:description>Bainbridge Island had been inhabited by the Suquamish people before the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott. In the early 20th century, a group of Indigenous people from British Columbia set up a camp on Eagle Harbor, near what is now Waterfront Park in Winslow. They harvested clams and fish from Eagle Harbor and other nearby waters to sell to Seattle residents and also dried salmon to preserve it for later use. In this photo, taken at the camp, men and children stand near their plank houses and salmon drying racks. Salmon fishing was an important part of culture and subsistence for many Indigenous people groups surrounding the Salish Sea.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>William Shelton (1868-1938), named Wha-ceh-dub or Whah-kay-dub in his native language of Lushootseed, was a cultural leader of the Snohomish and expert woodworker. During his lifetime, Indigenous people were confined to live on reservations and their children were taken to boarding schools. These schools prohibited Indigenous customs or languages in an attempt to &quot;civilize&quot; Indigenous children and eradicate their culture. At the time, many people both white and Indigenous believed that Indigenous people and their cultural identities would eventually vanish completely. 

William Shelton wanted to preserve his peoples’ stories and cultural values through art. Though totem poles were not traditionally made by the Indigenous peoples of Washington, he decided to adapt the form. He gathered stories from elders of multiple tribes in western Washington and began carving a 60-foot pole with figures that represented the stories. The pole also included figures called skla’letut which represent guardian spirits or supernatural powers and figures that Shelton remembered from his childhood on the Tulalip Reservation. He called the result a &quot;story pole.&quot; His first story pole was carved in 1912 and installed in 1913 in front of the Tulalip Indian School. Over the rest of his life Shelton carved at least 16 additional large story poles for public display. 

This image shows Shelton carving a story pole commissioned by the City of Everett. This pole was installed in 1923 and includes figures of an octopus, a man, and a frog.

    <dc:description>The Yakama (formerly spelled Yakima) people have lived in the Columbia River basin since time immemorial. During the winter, they lived in permanent villages built on the valley floor, where the climate was most temperate. Starting in spring, they traveled along the rivers and into the hills to gather food. Some gathered roots and berries, and others fished in rivers, especially the Columbia and the Yakima. In 1855, a confederation of 14 tribal groups signed the Yakama Nation Treaty with the United States and ceded most of their traditional lands, but reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. These groups were: Kah-miltpah, Palouse, Klickitat, See-ap-Cat, Klinquit, Sk-in-pah, Li-ay-was, Oche-Chotes, Wenatchapam, Pesquose, Yakama, Shyiks, Know-was-say-ee, and Wish-ham. All 14 groups are now part of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation and live on a reservation in central Washington. 

On January 29, 1921, seven members of the Yakama nation stopped in Seattle on their way back from Olympia, where they appeared before the Washington State Senate. The 1855 treaty, which guaranteed the right to fish the Yakima River, was threatened by restrictions at the new Prosser Dam in Benton County. This photo shows four members of the delegation, left to right: Chief Lo-páh-hin (Caesar Williams), Yes-to-lah-lemy (Mrs. Kate Williams), Mrs. Homer Watson, and Chief Homer Watson. They wear ceremonial clothing. The beadwork and woven bag are typical of Yakama handicrafts. Chief Lo-páh-hin was a chief from Oregon who joined the delegation; Chief Watson was second in authority among all Yakama groups.

    <dc:description>The Suquamish tribe lived on Bainbridge Island and fished in the waters of Puget Sound long before Seattle was founded. The Suquamish carved dugout canoes and used them to travel to fishing and hunting grounds across Puget Sound. Fishing, especially for salmon, was of central importance to the Suquamish for both subsistence and culture. Suquamish fishers used subtle environmental clues including tides, numbers of birds and seals, and water levels in streams to establish the best places and times to fish. The 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott reduced Suquamish land to some 7,800 acres at Port Madison, just north of the island on the Kitsap Peninsula. Members of the tribe frequently traveled by steamer from the Port Madison Reservation to Seattle to trade for supplies or transact other business. Today, most Suquamish people live on or around the Port Madison reservation and continue to practice their cultural traditions. 

In this photo, a group of Suquamish people waits at Seattle's Colman Dock for the steamer to Bainbridge Island after trying to collect land payments owed by the government. Tribal members have identified the six visible members of the group as, left to right: Doctor Peter, Charlie Youkton, Mrs. Chief Jacob, Chief Jacob Wahelchu, [unknown], and Mary Adams.

    <dc:description>At the turn of 19th to 20th centuries, Indigenous artists in the Pacific Northwest were making baskets and carvings specifically for the tourist trade and were experimenting with form and design. Making baskets for sale became an important income source for many Indigenous families. In this photo, two women and a boy sit by their baskets on Second Avenue, outside the Frederick &amp; Nelson department store. The twined baskets in the image are of the style made by the Makah people of Neah Bay and the Nuu-cha-nulth (formerly called Nootka) people of Vancouver Island.

    <dc:description>The Tulalip Tribes are a confederation of several Coast Salish peoples including the Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skykomish, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, Stillaguamish, and other allied tribes and bands. In the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, these groups ceded most of their land to the United States and reserved the Tulalip Reservation for their permanent homeland. They also reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. The name Tulalip comes from the Coast Salish word “dxwlilap,” meaning “small-mouth bay.” 

Catholic missionaries opened a boarding school on the Tulalip reservation in 1857. After a few years, the school began receiving funding from the federal government and in 1902 the government fully took over the school. That year, the original school buildings burned down, and a new school reopened in 1905. The school had a capacity of 200 students, who were as young as six. The photographer Ferdinand Brady had a government contract in the 1910s to photograph the people and activities around the Tulalip Indian School. The Tulalip school was one of many boarding schools for Indigenous children across the US. These schools were an attempt to “civilize” Indigenous peoples by forcing their children to assimilate to white-dominated Western society. One of the primary ways the schools undertook this goal was forcing students to speak English exclusively. Severe punishment, including physical punishment, was imposed when students spoke their native languages or otherwise resisted school authorities. 

This image shows the youngest students lined up in front of the girls’ dormitory. The upper floor contained the bedrooms (including a sick room), the middle floor had a music room in the left wing, a reading room in the right, and a dining room in the center. Showers and a play room were in the basement.

This image shows the students eating dinner. Even mealtimes had a strict military atmosphere; the students marched into the dining room and stood at their places until a signal was given to sit down. Boys and girls ate their meals at separate tables in the dining room. Students prepared and served the meals and cleaned up afterwards.

The former became extremely rare by the middle of the century, as the latter became more numerous.

    <dc:description>The Tulalip Tribes are a confederation of several Coast Salish peoples including the Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skykomish, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, Stillaguamish, and other allied tribes and bands. In the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, these groups ceded most of their land to the United States and reserved the Tulalip Indian Reservation for their permanent homeland. They also reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. The name Tulalip comes from the Coast Salish word &quot;dxwlilap,&quot; meaning &quot;small-mouth bay.&quot;

Fourth of July festivities at the Tulalip Indian Reservation often included a parade of canoes, pulled past the spectators by the Indian School's small motor launch. Shown in this photo are several canoes of different sizes with Camano Head in the background. The photographer Ferdinand Brady had a government contract in the 1910s to photograph the people and activities around the Tulalip reservation and boarding school.

In the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, these groups ceded most of their land to the United States and reserved the Tulalip Indian Reservation for their permanent homeland. They also reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. The name Tulalip comes from the Coast Salish word &quot;dxwlilap,&quot; meaning &quot;small-mouth bay.&quot;

Catholic missionaries opened a boarding school on the Tulalip reservation in 1857. After a few years, the school began receiving funding from the federal government and in 1902 the government fully took over the school. That year, the original school buildings burned down, and a new school reopened in 1905. The school had a capacity of 200 students, who were as young as six. The photographer Ferdinand Brady had a government contract in the 1910s to photograph the people and activities around the Tulalip Indian School. The Tulalip school was one of many boarding schools for Indigenous children across the US. These schools were an attempt to &quot;civilize&quot; Indigenous peoples by forcing their children to assimilate to white-dominated Western society. One of the primary ways the schools undertook this goal was forcing students to speak English exclusively. Severe punishment, including physical punishment, was imposed when students spoke their native languages or otherwise resisted school authorities. 

Buildings on the school grounds included the boys’ dormitory, the girls’ dormitory, a machine shop, the hospital, and other structures for the maintenance of the campus. Pupils spent half days in classes in this school building; here they learned spelling, reading, arithmetic, history, geography, and hygiene. The other half of their days were spent doing work to maintain the school and its grounds.

Student bands at the Tulalip school date back to 1860, when the school was operated by Catholic missionaries. That year, the school had 15 students and its all-boys band played in nearby towns to raise money for the school. In 1912, members of the band included, front row, left to right: Fred Curley (Lummi); George Jones (Tulalip); and Alfred Sam (Snohomish) at far right. Top row, left to right are: Joseph Joe; Aloysius Shelton (Tulalip); unknown; Ernest Cladoosby (Swinomish); and Leo George (Tulalip) at far right. The band played in the town of Marysville and traveled to other reservations to perform for special occasions.

Students split their days between classroom lessons and working to maintain the school. Among other assignments, boys were assigned to tend the school garden during their daily work period. They grew all of the vegetables eaten in the school dining room. The young fruit trees in the background grew to become part of the large orchard that produced fruit for the school. Here, several young boys pose for the camera, along with the school’s farmer and his wife and child.

Under most circumstances, traditional games such as slahal, the bone game, were discouraged by the &quot;Indian agents&quot; who administered the reservations. On this occasion, the anniversary of the signing of the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, the bone game is a center attraction. Teams have lined up facing each other while a crowd watches. The school boys, in their corduroy uniforms and hats, kneel in the foreground, and some of the girls look down from a balcony of the Girls' Building. Slahal is a gambling game played by many Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest. It involves hiding animal bones in one team's hands while the other guesses which hand holds the bones.

Illness was a constant fear among boarding school students and staff. The influenza epidemic of 1918 hit hard at Tulalip, and there was a very real threat of tuberculosis for many years. The hospital building had two wards, one for boys and one for girls. The dormitories each had a sick room for minor ailments. The staff in this photo include student nurses in training: Josie Cayou (Swinomish); Theresa Young (Tulalip); Myrtle Loughrey (Suquamish); Clara Jones (Swinomish); Emily Limon (Upper Skagit); and Annie Nason (Muckleshoot, in center). Nurse O’Dell and Dr. Buchanan stand at the rear.

Baseball, which somewhat resembles the Indigenous game of stick ball, was the most popular sport among students. In earlier years, players fashioned their own handmade bats and sometimes played barehanded. On the team pictured here are Clemont Bob, second from left in back row; Robert Shelton, third from right; Roy Loughrey, second from right; Joseph Joe, far right; and Augustus Day, seated on right. In the back row, holding a pennant, is William Shelton, an employee of the school and Robert’s father. William Shelton (1868-1938), named Wha-ceh-dub or Whah-kay-dub in his native language of Lushootseed, was a cultural leader of the Snohomish and expert woodworker and carver of story poles.

    <dc:description>The Tulalip Tribes are a confederation of several Coast Salish peoples including the Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skykomish, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, Stillaguamish, and other allied tribes and bands. In the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, these groups ceded most of their land to the United States and reserved the Tulalip Indian Reservation for their permanent homeland. They also reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. The name Tulalip comes from the Coast Salish word &quot;dxwlilap,&quot; meaning &quot;small-mouth bay.&quot; 

Loggers cleared most of the reservation land in the first part of the 20th century. The cut logs were hauled to the bay and floated in log booms to sawmills located throughout the area. The Tulalip Indian School also encouraged its students to become farmers, which required the clearing of forests on the reservation. Indigenous men, like the three seen here, found employment in all aspects of the lumber industry. 

The photographer Ferdinand Brady had a government contract in the 1910s to photograph the people and activities around the Tulalip reservation and boarding school.

Catholic missionaries opened a boarding school on the Tulalip reservation in 1857.

Severe punishment, including physical punishment, was imposed when students spoke their native languages or otherwise resisted school authorities. 

Every student at the boarding school spent at least half of his or her day working in some part of the operation. Boys rotated about every six weeks between jobs as carpenters, engineers, farmers or dairymen; girls were assigned to sewing, darning, laundry and kitchen work. As part of their regular work assignment, some of the young men chopped, split, and stacked hundreds of cords of wood to feed the steam boilers which supplied heat and power to the school buildings. Shown in this photo are Sebastian Williams (second from left), Woody Loughrey (fifth from left) and Clarence Shelton (third from right).

As part of their efforts to assimilate the students, school authorities limited contact between students and their families, but parents were allowed to visit briefly the school on weekends, and that may have been the occasion for this photo. Lucy and Bill Dunbar are shown with their children Josephine and Billy, Jr., who both attended the school.

The Tulalip Indian School was situated on reservation land along the shores of Tulalip Bay. During the early years of the school nearly all transportation was by water. A steamer arrived at the dock on a regular schedule carrying mail and visitors. After a fire in 1902 destroyed the older St. Anne’s Catholic Mission School, which had been at this site since 1861, the federal government funded construction of the buildings shown in this photograph. The new school opened in 1905. The Tulalip Indian School closed in 1932.

A sawmill located next to Tulalip Creek served the entire community. When wood or lumber were needed, logs were hauled in log booms across the bay to the mill. The creek was later dammed to supply electricity, and a powerhouse was built at the mill site. William Shelton (Snohomish), an employee of the school, served as the sawyer at this time. Shelton (1868-1938), named Wha-ceh-dub or Whah-kay-dub in his native language of Lushootseed, was a cultural leader of the Snohomish and expert woodworker and carver of story poles.

    <dc:description>The Tulalip Tribes are a confederation of several Coast Salish peoples including the Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skykomish, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, Stillaguamish, and other allied tribes and bands. In the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, these groups ceded most of their land to the United States and reserved the Tulalip Indian Reservation for their permanent homeland. They also reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. The name Tulalip comes from the Coast Salish word “dxwlilap,” meaning “small-mouth bay.”

Catholic missionaries opened a boarding school on the Tulalip reservation in 1857. After a few years, the school began receiving funding from the federal government and in 1902 the government fully took over the school. That year, the original school buildings burned down, and a new school reopened in 1905. The school had a capacity of 200 students, who were as young as six. The photographer Ferdinand Brady had a government contract in the 1910s to photograph the people and activities around the Tulalip Indian School. The Tulalip school was one of many boarding schools for Indigenous children across the US. These schools were an attempt to “civilize” Indigenous peoples by forcing their children to assimilate to white-dominated Western society. One of the primary ways the schools undertook this goal was forcing students to speak English exclusively. Severe punishment, including physical punishment, was imposed when students spoke their native languages or otherwise resisted school authorities. 

A member of the Tulalip Tribes contacted by the Museum of History and Industry identified the group in this photo as the milking brigade. Each day, the boys milked 40 to 50 cows in the dairy up the hill from the school. A published history of the Suquamish tribe, &quot;&quot;The Eyes of Chief Seattle,&quot;&quot; identifies the group as &quot;&quot;houseboys&quot;&quot;, implying that they cleaned and did other domestic work.

    <dc:description>The Makah people of the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula refer to themselves as Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx, which translates roughly to &quot;the people who live by the rocks and seagulls.&quot; The early Makah were skilled mariners, using several types of canoes which they carved from western red cedar for various purposes—war, whaling, fishing, sealing, carrying cargo, and long voyages. Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting. 

Young Doctor (circa 1851-1934) was a well-known Makah carver and musician whose life spanned a period of intense cultural change. Shown in this photograph with his wife Lizzie, Young Doctor holds an adze and a partially carved staff. Carvings of model canoes, a human figure, and a whale with floats attached are arranged on the steps of the building. 

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894. In his memoir &quot;Indian Days at Neah Bay&quot;, McCurdy stated that none could match the precise skill of Young Doctor, who had learned his craft from his father and was aided by spirit helpers.

    <dc:description>The Nuu-chah-nulth are a group of 14 First Nations peoples living on the west side of Vancouver Island: Ditidaht, Huu-ay-aht, Hupacasath, Tse-shaht, Uchucklesaht, Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Tla-o-qui-aht, Toquaht, Ucluelet, Ehattesaht, Kyuqout/Checlesaht, Mowachat/Muchalaht, and Nuchatlaht. They share cultural traditions and language but remain distinct nations, each with a hereditary chief. The Nuu-chah-nulth peoples were previously called the Nootka after European colonizers misunderstood their name and assumed them all to be one tribe, but they collectively chose this new name for themselves in 1978. Fishing and whaling were important parts of Nuu-chah-nulth culture, and they continue to protect their hunting and fishing rights on traditional territory. The Nuu-chah-nulth also have a tradition of skilled woodworking; they build totem poles, multifamily homes, and large oceangoing canoes. Over the 19th century, the increasing presence of settlers displaced the Nuu-chah-nulth from their historic land and they were forced onto reserves created by the Canadian government. As of 2022, the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council represents about 10,000 enrolled members across 14 First Nations on Vancouver Island. 

The renowned carver Atlieu (Charlie Williams) came from a Tla-o-qui-aht village on Vancouver Island but lived part of the time with the Makah in Neah Bay, Washington. He received several medals from the Canadian government in recognition of his woodcarving and metalwork, one of which he wears in this photograph. The ceremonial mask he is painting is a good example of Nuu-chah-nulth-style carving. The yew-wood club at the far left shows Atlieu’s distinctive style, with its intertwining animal figures. 

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

This photograph is a rare view of the inside of a traditional Makah longhouse around 1900. The smoke holes in the roof are open to let in light, fish are drying on racks near the ceiling, and rolled-up sails are suspended from ropes. Sealskins full of oil, various pots, baskets, a washboard, and cattail mats can also be seen. Traditional Makah longhouses were constructed of split cedar planks placed horizontally and lashed to upright poles with lengths of twisted cedar rope. Sleeping platforms lined the walls and each family had its own cooking place on the earthen floor. 

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

Quedessa was a Makah woman who did household work for the family of the James McCurdy, the photographer of this picture, in Neah Bay in the 1870s. She was married to Lighthouse Jack (also called Frank Parker), a Makah canoe maker and whaler, and she taught young James McCurdy about Makah basketry and Native foods and medicines. 

James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

Makah women have a tradition of basketry back to time immemorial. They use grasses, tree bark, or roots to make a variety of baskets and mats for various uses. Some Makah baskets are so tightly woven that they are watertight. Today, the tradition is carried on by both women and men. This photo, taken sometime between about 1900 and 1910, shows a Makah basketmaker on the beach, probably at Port Townsend. She is using cedar bark strips to make a dry storage container. 

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

    <dc:description>The people in this photograph are not identified, but the items they brought with them in their large sea-going canoes are visible-- bundles of dried cattails for weaving mats and a large, decorated Chinese trunk. The woman in the center appears to be holding a mirror. 

The buildings in the distant background indicate the location is probably Port Townsend, Washington. At this time, many Indigenous people traveled to Port Townsend to conduct trade on the beach. Most of the subjects of this image have their backs to the camera. At least one surviving account from Port Townsend indicates that white photographers often photographed Indigenous people, and that some of the Indigenous subjects resented being photographed, asked for compensation, or attempted to avoid being photographed. 

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

Halibut and salmon, the staples of the diet of Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, were either dried or smoked for winter use. In this photograph taken at Neah Bay, a Makah woman dries thinly-sliced fish in the sun. The scarecrows on the ends of the racks were intended to frighten away hungry birds. 

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

    <dc:description>The Makah people of the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula refer to themselves as Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx, which translates roughly to &quot;the people who live by the rocks and seagulls.&quot; The early Makah were skilled mariners, using several types of canoes which they carved from western red cedar for various purposes—war, whaling, fishing, sealing, carrying cargo, and long voyages. Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting. 

These Makah women of Neah Bay demonstrate the distinctive lidded baskets, sometimes called &quot;trinket baskets,&quot; for which the Makah are well-known. The bundled grass, which can be woven over a foundation of cedar bark, can be dyed various colors or left its natural cream color. These baskets combine geometric with naturalistic designs, and some are so tightly woven they are watertight. The Makah traded among Native groups as well as to non-Native collectors.

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

Seated on the beach in front of a tent, probably at Port Townsend, a Makah woman and child hold a puppy for a portrait. Another woman seated next to the pair shields her face from the photographer. At least one surviving account from Port Townsend indicates that white photographers often photographed Indigenous people, and that some of the Indigenous subjects resented being photographed, asked for compensation, or attempted to avoid being photographed. 

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

This photo, taken on the beach at Port Townsend, shows three white women examining baskets made by Indigenous people, whose canoes are landed nearby. One of the baskets is of finely-woven spruce root, the other is a coiled container of a style made in the interior of British Columbia. Baskets were traded among Native groups as well as to non-Native collectors.

    <dc:description>The Coast Salish style canoe was designed for use in the calm waters of Puget Sound and its many small bays and inlets. Both the prow and the stern curve upwards from a rounded bottom. Salish canoes were often painted black with brightly colored figures near the prow and stern. The Coast Salish style of canoe was more lightly constructed than other canoes built by Indigenous peoples and was not suited for longer voyages or in rough waters. It was also not as useful for fishing, carrying cargo, or raiding and as a result the style was gradually replaced by the more robust West Coast style of canoe, originally built by the Nuu-Chah-Nulth of Vancouver Island. 

This image shows a Coast Salish style canoe piloted by an Indigenous person in Port Townsend Bay on the Olympic Peninsula. A few other watercraft are visible in the right background, including a sailing ship and a steamship. The Klallam (also spelled S'Klallam), a Coast Salish group, lived in and around Port Townsend and the subject of this image may be a Klallam. 

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

    <dc:description>By the turn of the 20th century, Indigenous seafarers adapted cloth sails, usually of the sprit-rig type seen in this image. Traditional sails of woven mats and wood slats had been used prior to the arrival of Europeans, but they were replaced by cloth once the Native peoples began trading with the settlers. 

This photograph was probably taken in Port Townsend Bay or along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. It shows a West Coast style canoe equipped with a European style sail. The West Coast style of canoe was originally developed by the Nuu-Chah-Nulth peoples of Vancouver Island. It had a flatter bottom than other canoe styles and a vertical stern, making it more stable in rougher waters and able to carry more cargo. As a result, West Coast style canoes became the most common style in the Pacific Northwest during the late 19th century. 

The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

    <dc:description>From the late 1860s to the early 1890s, hop farming was an important activity in the valleys of the Puget Sound region, including Puyallup, White River, and Snoqualmie. Indigenous workers came from throughout the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska (but especially from regional tribes like the Puyallup, Snoqualmie, Muckleshoot, Duwamish, Sammamish, Lummi, and Nisqually) as a seasonal labor force to harvest these crops in late summer and early autumn. This seasonal work gave them a chance to earn the money they needed to buy things in a cash economy. 

In this 1890s photo, taken at Snoqualmie Hop Ranch in western Washington state, two Indigenous women stand in a hop field holding traditional cedar bark baskets. Other baskets filled with the pale hop blossoms sit on the ground in the background (right).

    <dc:description>The Snoqualmie people are a Coast Salish group who have lived in the Snoqualmie River Valley since time immemorial. They made dugout canoes which they used to navigate the river and reach Puget Sound. Traditionally the Snoqualmie burned off the bottom lands of the Snoqualmie Valley to create open areas that ensured an abundance of edible plants for foraging as well as supplied space for game animals to feed. In the early 19th century, the Snoqualmie were among the most powerful tribes around Puget Sound. They exerted economic influence over neighboring groups from Whidbey Island to Snoqualmie Pass. The Snoqualmie signed the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, ceding their land to the United States. They were temporarily assigned to live on the Tulalip reservation and were promised a reservation of their own. However, the US government reneged on its promise and no land was allocated for the Snoqualmie, most of whom moved back to their historic lands or stayed on the Tulalip reservation. The Snoqualmie finally received a reservation on their historic land in 1999.

This image is a portrait of Patkanim (or Pat Kanim), the chief of the Snoqualmie and Snohomish in the mid 19th century. In the 1840s, he wanted to force out the early white settlers. However, after visiting San Francisco in 1850, Patkanim decided that any fight against the settlers would be hopeless. He signed the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855 and aided the settlers against other Indigenous groups in the war of 1855-1856. Patkanim died in 1858 on the Tulalip Reservation. 

Photographer George N. Moore copied this portrait in the 1880s from an earlier photograph of Patkanim.

    <dc:description>The Puyallup people are a Coast Salish group whose historic lands are along the Puyallup River Valley. They call themselves &quot;Spuyalepabs&quot; in their native language of Lushootseed, meaning &quot;people from the bend at the bottom of the river.&quot; Before settlers arrived, the Puyallup lived in villages that spread from the Cascade foothills to the shores of Puget Sound. In 1854, Puyallup leaders signed the Medicine Creek Treaty under duress. The Puyallup ceded most of their land to the US in this treaty, but due to US government treaty violations in the size and location of reservations, the Puyallup peoples joined what is now called the Puget Sound War in 1855-1856. After the war ended, the treaty was renegotiated and the Puyallup reservation was enlarged. Since then, the Puyallup have fought for tribal rights, including in the fish wars of the 1960s and 70s and the Puyallup Land Claims Settlement in 1990.

Starting in the middle of the 19th century, church groups and the United States government set up boarding schools for Indigenous children. Here, children from many tribes were taught to speak English and were educated with a focus on agriculture and manual skills. They were separated from their elders, discouraged from learning their tribal traditions, and punished for speaking languages other than English. This photo shows the buildings and students of the Puyallup Indian School on the Puyallup Reservation, sometime between 1880 and 1889. The Puyallup Indian School opened in 1860 but expanded in the 1880s and 1890s, when a number of new buildings were added, and the school grew from 125 to more than 350 pupils. Later called the Industrial Boarding School and the Cushman School, it remained open until 1920. By that time, most Indigenous children attended local public schools.

    <dc:description>The Snohomish (written Sduhubš in their language) are a Coast Salish people who have lived along the Snohomish River since time immemorial. Their largest village was Hibulb, near the mouth of the river in what is now Everett. Like their other Coast Salish neighbors, the Snohomish used dugout canoes to travel along rivers and around Puget Sound. Salmon fishing was important to the Snohomish, both for sustenance and for cultural reasons. In 1855, Snohomish leaders signed the Treaty of Point Elliott. They ceded land to the United States but reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. The Snohomish were temporarily assigned to live on the Tulalip reservation and were promised their own reservation. However, the US government later reneged on this promise and most Snohomish people remained on the Tulalip reservation. As of 2023, the Snohomish are not a federally-recognized tribe. 

Pilchuck Julia, of the Snohomish people, was born around 1840 and witnessed the signing of the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott. After the treaty, she and her husband Pilchuck Jack stayed at their home on the Pilchuck River, near the town of Snohomish, Washington. Pilchuck Julia supported the family by making baskets and by selling clams, salmon, and berries. She was also known for her accurate weather predictions. During her lifetime, Julia was a much-photographed figure. Pilchuck Julia died of smallpox in 1923 and is buried in the G.A.R. Cemetery in Snohomish. The Pilchuck Julia Boat Landing in Snohomish was named in her honor in 2017.

    <dc:description>The Quileute are an Indigenous people whose historic lands are on the west side of the Olympic Peninsula, in the valleys of the Quillayute and Hoh Rivers. The Quileute are not related to either the Makah to the north or the Coast Salish peoples of western Washington, and the Quileute language is unrelated to any other in the world. Quileute land is directly exposed to the Pacific Ocean and receives about 9.5 feet of average yearly rainfall. To protect themselves, the Quileute made rainproof hats and clothing using the inner layer of cedar bark. The Quileute signed the Treaty of Olympia in 1856, in which they ceded their land and agreed to move to a reservation. In the treaty, the Quileute reserved rights for hunting, fishing, and gathering at all usual and accustomed places. However, because their land was so remote, reservations were not established until 1889 and 1893. Today, most Quileutes live on either the Quileute or the Hoh reservations.

In 1882, A.W. Smith established a school on Quileute land. He renamed Quileute individuals after Biblical characters and figures from US history. Seven years later Smith would become the &quot;Indian agent&quot; when the Quileute reservation was established. In this photo, Smith (left center) and his wife (right) pose with a group of Quileute school children next to a recently-built structure which may be the school.

From the late 1860s to the early 1890s, hop farming was an important activity in the valleys of the Puget Sound region, including Puyallup, White River, and Snoqualmie. Indigenous workers came from throughout the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska as a seasonal labor force to harvest crops in late summer and early autumn. Some Quileute people traveled all the way from the west coast of Washington's Olympic Peninsula to Puget Sound to pick hops. They relied on wages from seasonal labor to purchase goods in the currency-based economy of settlers. In 1889, a settler burned down the Quileute village of La Push while the inhabitants were away picking hops. The fire destroyed many of the last remaining masks, baskets, hunting equipment, and sacred items from before contact with the settlers. 

This image shows a group of Quileute people posing for a photo in a hop field. Woven baskets to carry the hops can be seen in the foreground. This image is a stereograph – two nearly identical images printed together to produce a 3D effect when seen through a special viewer.

    <dc:description>Slahal, also called the bone game, is one of many games played by Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest. A team member held up their hands, each of which contained a small bone, and the members of the opposite team tried to guess if a marked bone was in the right or left hand. Slahal often also involved gambling between the teams. Stakes could be high, and the games might last for hours. 

In this photo, taken sometime before Washington became a state in 1889, a group of Indigenous people play the bone game near their beached canoes. The two teams sit opposite one another in the sand. Some team members hold sticks which are used for scoring and for keeping up a rhythmic beat.

    <dc:description>The Steilacoom are a Coast Salish people whose historic lands are near the current town of Steilacoom, southwest of Tacoma. The Steilacoom consisted of five bands: Steilacoom, Sastuck, Spanaway, Tilhlow, and Segwallitchew. Unlike many of their neighbors the Steilacoom did not live near a glacier-fed river, but on land featuring a group of lakes and creeks. The Steilacoom were affected by settlers earlier than most other Indigenous peoples in Washington. Settlers encroached on their land starting in the 1830s, and the first incorporated town north of the Columbia River was in Steilacoom territory. In 1854, Steilacoom leaders signed the Medicine Creek Treaty and ceded their land to the United States. The US government expected Steilacoom land to be heavily populated with settlers and so did not assign the Steilacoom a reservation. Instead, the Steilacoom were assigned to live on neighboring reservations. Many refused to leave, however, and have remained on their historic lands. The Steilacoom Tribe is not federally recognized. 

Steilacoom John was a leader of the Steilacoom Tribe and a son of Ce-col-quin, a signer of the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty. In this photograph, John and his wife Goe-lit-sah (also called Anna or Annie) are seated in front of their home with a basket and other household items. This image is a stereograph – two nearly identical images printed together to produce a 3D effect when seen through a special viewer. A caption on the image describes John and Annie as &quot;Siwash Indians.&quot; The term &quot;Siwash&quot; was once used as a general term for Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, but it is now considered derogatory.

    <dc:description>In 1865 the Board of Trustees of Seattle passed Ordinance No. 5 banning Indigenous people from living in the city unless they worked for a non-Indigenous resident and lived on their employer’s property. Despite this attempt to enforce separation between Indigenous people and the settlers, Seattle depended on Indigenous people. Settlers relied on Native people for domestic work and for trade of fish, shellfish, and baskets. Indigenous people from across the Pacific Northwest also harvested hops in agricultural areas to the south and east of Seattle. 

Because they were excluded from the rest of the city, many Indigenous people stayed on Ballast Island, either when passing through, temporarily stopping, or living on the island year-round. Ballast Island was in the harbor at the foot of Washington Street and was created when sailing ships dumped their ballast in Elliott Bay in order to take on cargo. The only place close to Seattle’s business district where Indigenous people were allowed to live, Ballast Island lacked a source of fresh water or permanent structures. As the waterfront grew in the 1890s, Ballast Island was gradually covered and by the time the seawall was built in 1916, the island was almost completely gone and its Indigenous residents had again been displaced.

This image shows several canoes moored at Ballast Island, with an encampment visible on the island and the growing cityscape in the background.

    <dc:description>The Nooksack are a Coast Salish people whose historic lands centered on the Nooksack River drainage basin, from the shore to around Mount Baker in the east. They have their own language, also named Nooksack. On the edges of Nooksack land and in offshore waters, resources were shared with neighboring peoples, to whom the Nooksack were linked by shared descent or marriage ties. The Nooksack were party to the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855 and ceded their land in exchange for fishing, hunting, and gathering rights but the Nooksack did not receive a reservation. Many Nooksack refused to leave their homes and in the 1870s, they claimed homesteads on their historic land. The Nooksack tribe received a small reservation in 1970 and was federally recognized in 1973. Today, many of the 2,000 Nooksack tribal members live near their historic lands and continue to fish, both for income and to maintain cultural practices. 

&quot;Jim&quot; Yellakanim Seclamatan was a leader of the Nooksack people. He claimed a homestead in the upper Nooksack Valley, just outside the town of Lynden, Washington. Yellakanim died in April 1911 at the age of nearly 100 at the home of his granddaughter, Emily Williams.

    <dc:description>The Nooksack are a Coast Salish people whose historic lands centered on the Nooksack River drainage basin, from the shore to around Mount Baker in the east. They have their own language, also named Nooksack. On the edges of Nooksack land and in offshore waters, resources were shared with neighboring peoples, to whom the Nooksack were linked by shared descent or marriage ties. The Nooksack were party to the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855 and ceded their land in exchange for fishing, hunting, and gathering rights but the Nooksack did not receive a reservation. Many Nooksack refused to leave their homes and in the 1870s, they claimed homesteads on their historic land. The Nooksack tribe received a small reservation in 1970 and was federally recognized in 1973. Today, many of the 2,000 Nooksack tribal members live near their historic lands and continue to fish, both for income and to maintain cultural practices. 

In this photo, taken around 1900, several Nooksack people pose with a non-Indigenous man in front of a building near Lynden, a small town in Whatcom County on historic Nooksack land.

    <dc:description>The Cowlitz People are a Coast Salish group whose historic lands are along the Cowlitz and Lewis Rivers, in what is now southwestern Washington. Traditionally, the annual cycle of resource gathering determined where the Cowlitz People traveled and at what time of year – from river fishing in the spring, gathering roots and berries in summer and fall, and making crafts and repairing nets in the winter to prepare for the next spring. In 1855, Cowlitz leaders left negotiations with the Washington territorial government when the government required them to abandon their homeland in exchange for a reservation on the coast, to be shared with the other Indigenous peoples of southwestern Washington. The Cowlitz signed no treaty with the United States, but after the Puget Sound War of 1855-56, the Cowlitz’s land was taken by the US and sold to settlers. Many Cowlitz people remained in their historic lands and maintained their tribal ties to each other through the 20th century. The Cowlitz Indian Tribe was federally recognized in 2000 and the Cowlitz reservation was established near Ridgefield, Washington in 2010. 

This image shows the Cheholtz family, from the Toutle River band of the Cowlitz people. From left to right: Kathleen Cheholtz, Elisha Cheholtz, John Cheholtz, Peter Cheholtz (seated), Lemmea Cheholtz, and Henry Cheholtz. The man wearing a hat standing behind Peter is unidentified. Henry was the chief of the Toutle River band and Kathleen and Lemmea were his wives. The Cheholtz family lived on the banks of the Cowlitz River near the town of Castle Rock and this photo was taken in front of a fishing shack as they returned home.

    <dc:description>The Quileute are an Indigenous people whose historic lands are on the west side of the Olympic Peninsula, in the valleys of the Quillayute and Hoh Rivers. The Quileute are not related to either the Makah to the north or the Coast Salish peoples of western Washington, and the Quileute language is unrelated to any other in the world. Quileute land is directly exposed to the Pacific Ocean and receives about 9.5 feet of average yearly rainfall. To protect themselves, the Quileute made rainproof hats and clothing using the inner layer of cedar bark. The Quileute signed the Treaty of Olympia in 1856, in which they ceded their land and agreed to move to a reservation. In the treaty, the Quileute reserved rights for hunting, fishing, and gathering at all usual and accustomed places. However, because their land was so remote, reservations were not established until 1889 and 1893. Today, most Quileutes live on either the Quileute or the Hoh reservations.

Because Quileute land was distant from road or rail connections, the Quileute obtained supplies by loading up their large sea-going canoes. In this photo, a group unloads large sacks at First Beach, which borders the village of La Push. The canoes are of the West Coast style with an upturned prow and a vertical stern. The caption written on the image misidentifies the location as Mora, which is slightly up the Quillayute River from La Push.

    <dc:description>From the late 1860s to the early 1890s, hop farming was an important activity in the valleys of the Puget Sound region, including Puyallup, White River, and Snoqualmie. Indigenous workers came from throughout the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska (but especially from regional tribes like the Puyallup, Snoqualmie, Muckleshoot, Duwamish, Sammamish, Lummi, and Nisqually) as a seasonal labor force to harvest these crops in late summer and early autumn. This seasonal work gave them a chance to earn the money they needed to buy things in a cash economy. 

Many Native families traveled to the hop fields where they camped out during the harvest. Some returned to the same hop fields each year, and this became an important social event. Schools were closed during the harvest so that children could help in the fields. This photo, probably from the 1890s, shows Indigenous men, women, and children at work in a hop field near Kent, Washington. The dried blossoms of the hop plant, called cones, fill the large baskets in the foreground.

    <dc:description>The S’Klallam (also spelled Klallam) are a Coast Salish people whose historic lands stretch across the northern Olympic Peninsula from the current location of Port Townsend to the Hoko River, near Makah lands. They also lived on Whidbey Island and on the south shore of Vancouver Island. The S’Klallam lived in permanent longhouses during the winter, but in other seasons individual families spread out and camped at traditional sites to fish, hunt, or gather resources. In 1855, the S’Klallam signed the Point No Point Treaty and ceded their land to the United States but reserved rights to hunt, fish, and gather at usual and accustomed sites. The treaty stated that the S’Klallam would move to a reservation at Skokomish, but this site was distant from their traditional lands and most S’Klallams refused to leave. Beginning in the 1870s, many S’Klallam individuals privately purchased land on their traditional territory. As a result, separate S’Klallam groups emerged, which last to this day. One of the tribes lives on Vancouver Island at Becher Bay. The other three are on the northern Olympic Peninsula – the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (federally recognized in 1939), the Port Gamble S’Klallam Tribe (federally recognized in 1936), and the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe (federally recognized in 1981).

This is a portrait of Chits-A-Man-Han (nicknamed the “Duke of York” by the settlers) and his wife. He was chief of the S’Klallam in the 1850s and was one of the signers of the Point No Point Treaty. This image is a composite, created by combining separate photos of Chits-A-Man-Han and his wife.

    <dc:description>Chesheeahud (also spelled Cheshiahud) was a Duwamish chief and guide to the lakes and rivers around what is now Seattle, living between the mid-19th and early 20th centuries. He led a village called hehs-KWEE-kweel (meaning Skate), at the south edge of the mouth of Union Bay onto Lake Washington. hehs-KWEE-kweel was near a vital portage used by the Duwamish between Lake Union and Lake Washington. Chesheeahud and his wife Tleebuleetsa lived on a plot of land located at Edgewater Park near the point at the south edge of the mouth of Union Bay onto Lake Washington. They were the last Duwamish people to live on Lake Union as the city grew and dislocated the Indigenous residents. Because of this, the settlers often called them the &quot;last of the Lake Union Indians.&quot; Chesheeahud was also called &quot;Lake Union John&quot; and the derogatory name &quot;Chudups (also spelled Chodups) John&quot; by the settlers, while Tleebuleetsa was called &quot;Madeline.&quot; After Tleebuleetsa died, Chesheeahud moved to the Port Madison reservation, where many other Duwamish people had been displaced to after the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855.

In this photo, Chesheeahud and several other people sit in a canoe on Lake Union. A mast sticks out beyond the vessel's notched prow. These canoes carried enough supplies to last for journeys lasting several months and could travel far inland on the many rivers in the region. This Coast Salish canoe design was later replaced by the West Coast style through contact with tribes from the Olympic Peninsula and Vancouver Island.

    <dc:description>Indigenous people from many parts of the Pacific Northwest came to Seattle to trade and buy supplies. In this photo, a woman holding a basket stands by a large canoe at the Seattle waterfront. The design of the canoe and her hat suggest that she is from one of the First Nations in Vancouver Island or another part of coastal Canada. Her canoe is of the Northern style, designed for long journeys in open water. It has a high prow, flared sides, and a rounded bottom to help with speed and buoyancy. The photo was taken in Seattle, two blocks south of King Street, near First Avenue.

    <dc:description>The Yakama (formerly spelled Yakima) people have lived in the Columbia River basin since time immemorial. During the winter, they lived in permanent villages built on the valley floor, where the climate was most temperate. Starting in spring, they traveled along the rivers and into the hills to gather food. Some gathered roots and berries, and others fished in rivers, especially the Columbia and the Yakima. In 1855, a confederation of 14 tribal groups signed the Yakama Nation Treaty with the United States and ceded most of their traditional lands, but reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. These groups were: Kah-miltpah, Palouse, Klickitat, See-ap-Cat, Klinquit, Sk-in-pah, Li-ay-was, Oche-Chotes, Wenatchapam, Pesquose, Yakama, Shyiks, Know-was-say-ee, and Wish-ham. All 14 groups are now part of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation and live on a reservation in central Washington. 

This image taken by a Yakima-area photographer, shows a Yakama man identified as Captain Billy and a woman whose name is unknown, possibly his wife. Captain Billy wears animal skin decorations in his hair, and the woman carries a cornhusk bag on her horse's saddle. Both horses wear feathers on their bridles. Writing on the image describes the woman as a &quot;&quot;squaw.&quot;&quot; This word is a sexist and racist slur used to refer to Indigenous North American women.

    <dc:description>The Indigenous peoples of the Columbia Plateau include many different tribal groups. The Plateau peoples’ historic lands are in what is now British Columbia, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. In Washington, the Yakama, Nez Perce, Spokane, Colville, and other Plateau tribes live east of the Cascade Range in the Columbia River watershed. 

In this portrait, part of a series taken in a Yakima-area photographer's studio, a young Indigenous man poses wearing a beaded belt, necklace, choker, armbands, and earrings. The large horn-shaped dentalium shells in his necklace came from the waters off Vancouver Island and were traded long distances to inland tribes. Traditionally, both men and women wore shell and bead ornaments. The dentalium shells were often interspersed with blue or red glass beads.

The seated woman is identified as Cadina Chenoweth (1875-1940), daughter of Young Chief Chenoweth of the Mid-Columbia and Cascade Tribes. Her companion holds a beaded bag, which was a popular item among Indigenous people in the region at the time.

    <dc:description>The Klickitat (also spelled Klikitat) are an Indigenous group whose historic lands are along the Klickitat and White Salmon Rivers east of the Cascade mountains in Washington. Their language is related to the language of the Yakama, their eastern neighbors. The Klickitat fished for salmon in the rivers of their homeland and were also involved in trade among different Indigenous groups because of their convenient location near the Columbia River between Coast Salish tribes to the west and other tribes further east. In 1855, the Klickitat signed a treaty ceding their land to the United States while reserving rights to fish, hunt, and gather at all usual and accustomed places. The Klickitat were assigned to live on the Yakama reservation and today most Klickitats are part of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. 

This portrait of a young woman, identified by the subject's granddaughter as Mattie Spencer, is part of a series taken in a Yakima-area photography studio early in the 20th century. She holds a cornhusk bag with a typical geometric design and wears a patterned blanket, beaded belt, necklace and earrings.

    <dc:description>This Tlingit totem was carved around 1790 to honor a tribal woman named Chief-of-All-Women and it was placed in the village of Tongass on the Alaska coast. In 1899, a group of leading Seattle businessmen on a goodwill tour of southeastern Alaska stole the totem and brought it back to Pioneer Square. The businessmen were indicted for the theft, but the case was later dismissed. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, which sponsored the tour, eventually paid a $500 fine to the Tlingit Tribe. After rot and fire damaged the original pole in 1938, Tlingit craftsmen including several descendants of the carvers of the original pole, carved a replica and donated it to Seattle to replace the original. 

In this photo, taken in October 1899, a large crowd has gathered for the dedication of the original totem pole.

    <dc:description>Hwehlchtid (called Salmon Bay Charlie by the settlers) of the Shilshole people lived on the southern shore of Salmon Bay, near present-day Ballard, which was then outside of Seattle. Hwehlchtid and his wife Chilohleet'sa (Madeline) remained in their traditional homeland long after others of their tribe had moved away. 

This photograph showing Hwehlchtid and Chilohleet’sa’s home, later made into a postcard, was taken at low tide looking west towards Puget Sound. In the early 20th century, Seattle boosters and businesses exploited images of Indigenous people and their culture for sale on postcards or in advertising in order to market the city.

    <dc:description>In 1865 the Board of Trustees of Seattle passed Ordinance No. 5 banning Indigenous people from living in the city unless they worked for a non-Indigenous resident and lived on their employer’s property. Despite this attempt to enforce separation between Indigenous people and the settlers, Seattle depended on Indigenous people. Settlers relied on Native people for domestic work and for trade of fish, shellfish, and baskets. Indigenous people from across the Pacific Northwest also harvested hops in agricultural areas to the south and east of Seattle. 

This 1880s photo shows a Native encampment in Seattle, probably located near the western end of Bell Street. Because they were excluded from the rest of the city, many Indigenous people camped on the waterfront when visiting or passing through Seattle.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>In 1909, Jack Adams (1853-1931), a member of the Suquamish Tribe, built a canoe for a canoe race at Seattle's Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. Adams built the vessel from a single 48-foot log. On September 6, the canoes raced to the finish line at the foot of the fair's Pay Streak, in Portage Bay. In this photo, Adams and ten other men paddle the canoe on Portage Bay.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The Cayuse people historically lived in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington, where they fish from rivers that flow into the Columbia. They were in an advantageous position between the coast and the Great Plains, allowing them to trade between both. The Cayuse owned horses in large numbers, which led to their expansion and brought them into contact with tribes on the coast as well as further inland. In 1855, the Cayuse in confederation with the Walla Walla and the Umatilla peoples signed a treaty with the United States. The tribes ceded their land but reserved rights to hunt, fish, and gather at usual and accustomed places. They also reserved the Umatilla Indian Reservation as a permanent homeland. Today, most Cayuse live on the Umatilla Indian Reservation. 

In this photo, Cayuse twins Tax-a-Lax and Alompum (Emma and Edna Jones) look out from their undecorated wood and fabric cradleboards. One source identifies the twins as grandnieces of Chief Joseph, a leader of the Nez Perce people. Various tribes in interior Washington and Oregon traditionally wrapped their infants tightly and laced them into cradleboards. Cradleboards were often made of wood, with a covering of leather or fabric. Some were quite plain while others were highly decorated with beadwork and shells. Women would carry cradleboards in their arms or on their backs, so they could care for infants while performing other tasks. 

From 1889 to 1891, photographer Lee Moorhouse served as “Indian Agent” on the Umatilla Reservation, and many of his subjects were members of the Umatilla, Cayuse, and Walla Walla tribes.

    <dc:description>The Hän people historically lived along the Yukon River near the border of eastern Alaska and western Yukon Territory. One of their largest and most important sites was Tr’ochëk, where the Klondike and Yukon Rivers meet. It was there that the Klondike Gold Rush started in 1896 and within a few years thousands of people had come to Hän lands hoping to find gold. The prospectors drove game animals away and took over the land, which threatened the Hän people's traditional lifeways. Chief Isaac of the Hän people, shown here, saw the impacts that the Gold Rush had on his people and their culture. In response, he moved them three miles downriver to Moosehide and entrusted knowledge of many of their songs and dances to Indigenous people in Alaska for safekeeping. In the aftermath of the gold rush, the Hän strove to balance Indigenous traditions against cultural influences from the settlers. Chief Isaac continued to lead the Hän until his death in 1932. Today, most Hän people are part of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation in Dawson City. The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in began negotiating their Land Claim in 1991 and it came into effect in 1998.

    <dc:description>In August 1919, the Puget Sound Bridge &amp; Dredging Company launched the steamer &quot;Snoqualmie&quot; at its Seattle shipyard on Harbor Island. The vessel was named for the Snoqualmie Tribe, in honor of the aid they gave the settlers against other Indigenous groups in the war of 1855-1856, now referred to as the Puget Sound War. Many tribal members traveled to Seattle and took part in the launching ceremonies. This photo, taken August 11, 1919, shows Kate Borst (1855-1938) christening the steamer &quot;Snoqualmie&quot; by breaking a bottle of champagne against the bow. Kate Borst was a relative of Chief Si’ahl (Chief Seattle) and the half-sister of Snoqualmie chief Jerry Kanim, who was a nephew of 19th century Snoqualmie chief Patkanim.

    <dc:description>In 1936, the Coupeville Indian Water Festival culminated in a race of traditional canoes crewed by Indigenous people from Washington and British Columbia. Eleven canoes started the three-mile race in Penn's Cove on August 9, 1936, but only eight managed to finish. High winds caused three canoes to sink; the Lone Eagle from the Lummi Reservation sank only a few feet from the finish line. Fortunately, no racers were injured and the canoes were undamaged. The winner of the race was Saanich No. 5 from the Saanich Tribe in British Columbia. About 12,000 viewers watched the competition.

    <dc:description>siastenu (1857-1958), also named Ruth Sehome Shelton, was born in 1857 on Guemes Island, in one of the last remaining Samish longhouses. She was descended from the Dungeness Klallam, the Lummi, and the Samish peoples. siastenu spread the oral histories of the Coast Salish peoples and carried knowledge of that history into the 20th century. In 1889, siastenu married Wheakadim or Whah-kay-dub (also named William Shelton), who was a leader of the Snohomish people. 

This image shows siastenu at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer office on November 16, 1940. She visited the newspaper to deliver a forecast of a cold and harsh winter ahead. While at the PI, siastenu had a conversation in Chinook Jargon with Ed Dalby, the newspaper’s marine editor. Chinook Jargon was a trade language derived from French, English, and several different Indigenous languages. siastenu noted that few white people at that time knew Chinook Jargon and complimented Dalby on his grasp of the language.

    <dc:description>The women from coastal Washington's Indigenous tribes are known for their basketry. They made twined, coiled, and plaited baskets for gathering clams and berries, storing and serving food, and many other purposes. Basketry techniques were also used for hats and other clothing. At the start of the 20th century, Indigenous artists in the Pacific Northwest were making baskets specifically for the tourist trade and were experimenting with form and design. Making baskets for sale became an import income source for many Indigenous families. 

This 1926 photo shows five women making baskets on a beach, possibly at Taholah, in the Quinault Reservation on Washington's Olympic Peninsula. The Quinault are a Coast Salish people whose historic territory was the southwestern Olympic Peninsula.

    <dc:description>The Swinomish are a Coast Salish group whose historic lands were in the Skagit and Samish River valleys as well as Whidbey, Camano, Fidalgo Islands, and the San Juan Islands. They lived in large permanent villages during the winter, then spread out in spring and summer to gather resources – salmon from the rivers, shellfish from the coastline, cedar wood and berries from inland forests. In 1855, a confederation of four major groups and their allied bands – Aboriginal Swinomish, Lower Skagit, Kikiallus, and Aboriginal Samish – signed the Treaty of Point Elliott with the United States. They ceded their land to the US while reserving rights to hunt, fish, and gather at usual and accustomed places, as well as reserving the Swinomish Reservation on southeastern Fidalgo Island for a permanent homeland. Today, most descendants of these groups live on the Swinomish Reservation. 

On January 22, 1939, the tribes living at the Swinomish Reservation near La Conner, Washington, held their annual Treaty Day observance. The event marked the anniversary of the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott. In addition to the tribes from the Swinomish Reservation, tribal members from the Saanich and Cowichan (in British Columbia) and from the Puyallup came to the celebration. Treaty Day events included feasting, singing, drumming, and dancing. The 1939 Treaty Day was the first year that Swinomish chiefs allowed the ceremonies to be photographed. In this photo, Patrick George (seated) beats on a drum while tribal elder Joseph Joe sings.

    <dc:description>The S’Klallam (also spelled Klallam) are a Coast Salish people whose historic lands stretch across the northern Olympic Peninsula from the current location of Port Townsend to the Hoko River, near Makah lands. They also lived on Whidbey Island and on the south shore of Vancouver Island. The S’Klallam lived in permanent longhouses during the winter, but in other seasons individual families spread out and camped at traditional sites to fish, hunt, or gather resources. In 1855, the S’Klallam signed the Point No Point Treaty and ceded their land to the United States but reserved rights to hunt, fish, and gather at usual and accustomed sites. The treaty stated that the S’Klallam would move to a reservation at Skokomish, but this site was distant from their traditional lands and most S’Klallams refused to leave. Beginning in the 1870s, many S’Klallam individuals privately purchased land on their traditional territory. As a result, separate S’Klallam groups emerged, which last to this day. One of the tribes lives on Vancouver Island at Becher Bay. The other three are on the northern Olympic Peninsula – the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (federally recognized in 1939), the Port Gamble S’Klallam Tribe (federally recognized in 1936), and the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe (federally recognized in 1981).

In this 1939 photo, a S’Klallam couple, Mr. and Mrs. George Adams, stand outside their home. The photo was probably taken on the Port Gamble Reservation. MOHAI had previously identified them as Snoqualmie tribe members living on the Tulalip Reservation.

In February 1939, a Seattle Post-Intelligencer photographer took this photo of two Port Gamble S'Klallam boys carrying a bucket of clams at Point Julia. The boy on the left is Claude &quot;Skip&quot; George and on the right is Benny Anderson, Claude's uncle. The dog is George's dog Skipper. Skip George (1930-2011) was raised at Point Julia by grandparents and great-grandparents who spoke the S’Klallam language and passed on memories of S’Klallam culture from the mid-19th century. George went on to become a historian who preserved and passed on knowledge of S'Klallam history and culture.

    <dc:description>In 1941, Swinomish leader Tandy Wilbur arranged a competition between two Indigenous racing canoes and two shells crewed by the University of Washington Huskies. Wilbur had recently become chairman of the Swinomish Tribal Community, and he intended the race to help form bonds among the several different tribal groups living together on the Swinomish reservation. He also wanted to use publicity from the race to build economic ties to the settler communities around the reservation. The two canoes participating in the race were named 'Lone Eagle' and 'Susie Q.' The four crews made a series of 100-yard sprints down Swinomish Slough, from the Swinomish Reservation to the town of La Conner. When interviewed in the 1990s, members from both sides remembered winning the race. 

This image shows three of the racing craft. In the center is a UW shell, with eight rowers, with a Native canoe behind it, with ten rowers. The second UW shell is behind and to the left of the canoe.

    <dc:description>The United States' entry into World War II in December 1941 created labor shortages as many men left civilian jobs to join the military. On the West Coast, the shortage was exacerbated by the forced removal of Japanese Americans, many of whom were farmers. In the summer of 1943, the Vashon Island Packing Company hired 80 First Nations people from British Columbia to weed and harvest strawberries, loganberries, and currants. The Indigenous workers replaced Filipino workers who were now growing vegetables and working in war industries. The First Nations farmworkers earned 50 to 60 cents an hour, reportedly two to three times what they might have made at home. Those who stayed the whole summer had their transportation to and from Canada paid for as well. Under the 18th century Jay Treaty between Britain and the United States, Indigenous people could freely cross the US-Canada border by proving their tribal status. First Nations people had begun working on Bainbridge and Vashon Islands as fruit pickers in the early 1900s. Most of them were women, because men from their tribes stayed closer to home to work as loggers or dockworkers.

This June 1943 photo shows a group of Indigenous workers, mostly women, in a Vashon Island strawberry field.

    <dc:description>&quot;The Makah people of the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula refer to themselves as Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx, which translates roughly to &quot;&quot;the people who live by the rocks and seagulls.&quot;&quot; The early Makah were skilled mariners, using several types of canoes which they carved from western red cedar for various purposes—war, whaling, fishing, sealing, carrying cargo, and long voyages. Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting. 

In August of each year the Makah people hold the annual Makah Days celebration at Neah Bay, which celebrates the Makah people gaining full US citizenship in 1924. In their 1945 festival, the Makah also celebrated the end of World War II, the imminent return of 45 tribal members serving in the military, and the dedication of a new housing project on the reservation. Tribal leader Charlie Swan, whose son served in the Pacific, led the dancing. In this August photo, Swan wears a button blanket and wooden mask, and he holds a painted drum. Swan, who was well known for his dancing, had a dance troupe which gave performances throughout the Pacific Northwest.

    <dc:description>The first rodeo at Ellensburg, Washington, opened in September 1923. For many years, the &quot;Indian Village&quot; was one of the more popular attractions at the rodeo. There, Indigenous people from many tribes camped in teepees and put on dancing and riding performances. In 1945, 100 Yakama Natives camped and performed at the rodeo and rode in its parades. 

In this 1945 photo, young dancers from an unidentified tribe demonstrate fancy dancing at the rodeo. The fancy dance, also called the Oklahoma Feather Dance, was invented in the early 20th century by Gus McDonald, a member of the Ponca tribe in Oklahoma. It evolved from earlier Indigenous dance traditions and has been performed by people from many different Indigenous tribes at celebrations and competitions.

    <dc:description>Port Townsend, site of a S’Klallam village prior to the arrival of settlers in the mid-1800s, became an important trading center by the end of the 19th century. Indigenous peoples from Canada and the tribes of Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula gathered along the shores of Port Townsend Bay to trade and socialize. Many also stopped here on their way to or from Puget Sound, including for seasonal work in the hop fields south and east of Seattle. In this photograph, canoes line the beach and tents are pitched above the high tide line.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Many Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest traditionally carve canoes from cedar. The canoes are made in several styles and sizes, and the larger ocean-going canoes required multiple people to launch. This image taken in late August 1899 shows a group of Indigenous people dragging a cedar dugout canoe towards the waters of Port Townsend Bay. In the late 19th century, many Indigenous people traveled to Port Townsend to conduct trade on the beach. Canoes were often landed backwards, with the prow facing the water, in order to facilitate the next launching. In areas of frequent launchings and landings, the people cleared the beach rocks away, leaving open &quot;canoe runs,&quot; some of which can still be seen on certain Olympic Peninsula beaches. 

This canoe is of the West Coast style, as seen by its upturned prow made to resemble a wolf head. West Coast style canoes were first created by the Nuu-chah-nulth peoples of Vancouver Island, but they were adopted by many Indigenous groups across the Pacific Northwest because they were more suited to traveling in rougher waters and open ocean.

    <dc:description>Many Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest traditionally carve canoes from cedar. The canoes are made in several styles and sizes, and the larger ocean-going canoes required multiple people to launch. This image taken in late August 1899 shows a group of Indigenous people dragging a cedar dugout canoe towards the waters of Port Townsend Bay, with Point Wilson visible in the background. In the late 19th century, many Indigenous people traveled to Port Townsend to conduct trade on the beach. Canoes were often landed backwards, with the prow facing the water, in order to facilitate the next launching. In areas of frequent launchings and landings, the people cleared the beach rocks away, leaving open &quot;canoe runs,&quot; some of which can still be seen on certain Olympic Peninsula beaches. 

This canoe is of the West Coast style, as seen by its upturned prow made to resemble a wolf head. West Coast style canoes were first created by the Nuu-chah-nulth peoples of Vancouver Island, but they were adopted by many Indigenous groups across the Pacific Northwest because they were more suited to traveling in rougher waters and open ocean.

    <dc:description>The Makah people of the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula refer to themselves as Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx, which translates roughly to &quot;the people who live by the rocks and seagulls.&quot; The early Makah were skilled mariners, using several types of canoes which they carved from western red cedar for various purposes—war, whaling, fishing, sealing, carrying cargo, and long voyages. Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting. 

This photograph shows two Makah people from Neah Bay camped on the beach at Port Townsend in September 1899. In the late 19th century, many Indigenous people traveled to Port Townsend to conduct trade on the beach. The young Makah woman wears a dress of cloth which was probably bought or traded for. Her earrings are probably Native-made.

Port Townsend, site of a S’Klallam village prior to the arrival of settlers in the mid-1800s, became an important trading center by the end of the 19th century. Indigenous peoples from Canada and the tribes of Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula gathered along the shores of Port Townsend Bay to trade and socialize. Many also stopped here on their way to or from Puget Sound, including for seasonal work in the hop fields south and east of Seattle. This candid photograph shows a Makah group, likely a family, resting on the beach. Their tent appears to be commercially manufactured. The man on the right seems to be splitting firewood.

Here five members of the Makah tribe gave a preview of their upcoming dance performance upon arriving at Colman Dock on March 22, 1941. Charlie Swan (at right, with mask), his wife, and his daughter Delores are shown with Alexander Green (playing the drum) and his wife. The group came to Seattle to attend a Chamber of Commerce luncheon promoting tourism to the Olympic Peninsula. Charlie (also spelled Charley) Swan was a chief of the Makah. He was well known for his dancing, and had a dance troupe which gave performances throughout the Pacific Northwest.

    <dc:description>The Snoqualmie people are a Coast Salish group who have lived in the Snoqualmie River Valley since time immemorial. They made dugout canoes which they used to navigate the river and reach Puget Sound. Traditionally the Snoqualmie burned off the bottom lands of the Snoqualmie Valley to create open areas that ensured an abundance of edible plants for foraging as well as supplied space for game animals to feed. In the early 19th century, the Snoqualmie were among the most powerful tribes around Puget Sound. They exerted economic influence over neighboring groups from Whidbey Island to Snoqualmie Pass. Snoqualmie chief Patkanim (also spelled Pat Kanim) signed the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, ceding the Snoqualmie people’s land to the United States. They were temporarily assigned to live on the Tulalip reservation and were promised a reservation of their own. However, the US government reneged on its promise and no land was allocated for the Snoqualmie, most of whom moved back to their historic lands or stayed on the Tulalip reservation. The Snoqualmie finally received a reservation on their historic land in 1999.

This image shows Snoqualmie chief Jerry Kanim (the nephew of Patkanim) with some of his family members. On February 21, 1948, Jerry Kanim and representatives of several other tribes met at Eagles Hall in Carnation, Washington, on historic Snoqualmie land to discuss ways of pressing their claims to the reservation land that had been promised to them.

    <dc:description>The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe is made up of descendants of the Duwamish and Upper Puyallup peoples who lived near Puget Sound and its associated waterways since time immemorial. Muckleshoot ancestors lived in villages that were tied together by marriage bonds, trade, shared ceremonies, and use of the same land. This network of interconnected villages extended far beyond the Upper Puyallup and Duwamish tribes, which allowed Muckleshoot ancestors to fish, hunt, and gather across a large area, from the west side of Puget Sound to the Cascade Mountains. The Upper Puyallup and Duwamish tribes signed treaties in 1854 and 1855 respectively, which ceded their land to the United States in exchange for reserving rights to hunt, fish, and gather at usual and accustomed places. The tribes were also promised reservations as permanent homelands. A conflict between the settlers and several Indigenous groups, now called the Puget Sound War, occurred from 1855-56 and in its aftermath a reservation was established on a plain called Muckleshoot at the junction of the White and Green Rivers. After the Muckleshoot Reservation was established, its people gradually came to be known as the Muckleshoot Tribe, instead of by their historical tribal affiliations. Since the early 20th century, the Muckleshoot people have defended their treaty rights, especially fishing rights. 

Salmon was historically a mainstay food for the Indigenous tribes of the Pacific Northwest and has remained an important part of their diet. The catching, preparing, and cooking of salmon also remain significant parts of the culture of many Indigenous peoples in Washington. In this photo, several women on the Muckleshoot Reservation help prepare salmon, which has been cut and strung onto sticks and then suspended over an open fire to grill. The wood is probably alder, which gives a distinctive flavor to fresh-cooked salmon and was the preferred fuel.

    <dc:description>The Tlingit people have lived on the coast and islands of what is now southeastern Alaska since time immemorial. Tlingit society is organized into clans, which follow maternal descent. Fishing, gathering, and hunting were central to historic Tlingit lifeways. They used salmon, shellfish, seals, berries, deer, and other food sources, making sure to use every part for different purposes, not wasting anything. The Tlingit also had many uses for cedar trees, from houses, to totems and baskets. Cedar was also used for canoes, which were one of the main modes of transport for the Tlingit and enabled them to travel and trade not only amongst each other but also with neighboring peoples north and south along the Pacific coast. 

This young Tlingit boy is photographed in a photographer's studio wearing a blanket and a woven spruce root hat typical of the northern Northwest Coast Indigenous peoples. The spruce root is twined so tightly that it sheds water, and the hat's rim is decorated with a geometric pattern.

    <dc:description>The Tlingit are a group of Indigenous peoples whose traditional home is on the coast of southeastern Alaska. The Tlingit, as well as neighboring groups, weave elaborate ceremonial blankets with abstracted images of animals. The blankets are called Chilkat blankets after one of the Tlingit tribes, and are traditionally worn during important events.

The man in this photograph wears a woven Chilkat blanket and a wooden headdress carved with the image of a bear. His name, written on the photograph as Tal Tan Billy, implies that he was connected with the Tahltan people who lived inland from the British Columbia coast, along the Stikine River. The subject's ceremonial clothing is typical of the Tlingit; Tahltan artwork was influenced by Tlingit styles. The Tahltan and Tlingit peoples had a complex relationship that involved trade networks, intermarriage, and some overlapping territories.

    <dc:description>The Tlingit people have lived on the coast and islands of what is now southeastern Alaska since time immemorial. Tlingit society is organized into clans, which follow maternal descent. Fishing, gathering, and hunting were central to historic Tlingit lifeways – they used salmon, shellfish, seals, berries, deer, and other food sources. They used every part for different purposes, not wasting anything. The Tlingit also had many uses for cedar trees, from houses to totems, canoes, and baskets. Canoes were one of the main modes of transport for the Tlingit and enabled them to travel and trade not only amongst each other but also with neighboring peoples north and south along the Pacific coast. 

The Taku are a tribe of northern Tlingit whose traditional lands extended along the Taku River and included the area northeast of Juneau, Alaska. The northern Tlingit traded heavily with merchant vessels and bartered for large numbers of imported goods. In this image, Chief Anotklosh (also spelled 'Ano-Thlosh' or 'Ano-Tlosh'), chief of the Taku, wears a woven Chilkat blanket made from cedar bark and mountain goat wool which had been dyed yellow, black and blue-green. He holds a carved wooden bird rattle and wears a European military-style cap. Chilkat blankets, named after one of the Tlingit tribes, are elaborate ceremonial blankets made by the Tlingit as well as neighboring peoples. They feature abstracted images of animals and are traditionally worn during important events.

The two Tlingit people in this photograph wear elaborate painted and beaded tunics. The man (left) wears a tall hat topped with rings which signify the number of potlatches he has given. He holds a painted paddle with a fringe of deer hoof rattles. The woman (right) wears a nose ring and a bear claw headdress. She carries a crescent-shaped object painted with a raven design. Both individuals wear face paint. The woman is identified as Kaw-claa in another photograph in the museum's collection. Potlatches are traditional feasts involving extensive gift-giving as a show of power and wealth. Potlatches are a traditional part of many Northwest Coast Indigenous cultures.

    <dc:description>The Chilkat are a Tlingit tribe who have lived in and around their village of Klukwan on the Chilkat River, in southeastern Alaska since time immemorial. They lived on foods available on their lands as well as trading with other tribes on the Pacific coast and inland. Settlers came to Chilkat lands in large numbers in the early 20th century, and they dispossessed the Chilkat of most of their land. US authorities attempted to suppress Chilkat culture by prohibiting potlatches and other traditional customs. However, their efforts failed and the Chilkat people maintained many of their traditions. Today most Chilkat people live in Klukwan. 

This image shows three brothers and leaders of the Kak-Von-Tons, a part of the Chilkat tribe. They are identified as Ka-sh-ak (also spelled Kaalgéi), Skan-doo (Skundoo or Sx'andu.oo), and Ind-a-yanek (Swatka or Yindayáank') and they pose together wearing their ceremonial clothing. Two of the brothers have elaborately patterned Chilkat blankets, and the third wears a shirt decorated with deer hoofs. The man in the center also displays a carved wooden bird helmet with feathers attached. Each man holds a carved and painted bird-shaped rattle.

The Auke are a tribe of the Tlingit. Their historic lands are near the current location of Juneau, Alaska. The Auke, like other southeast Alaska groups, traveled to fishing camps during the summer months. This photograph of an Auke fishing camp on the beach shows filleted halibut drying in front of the leftmost tent, and a mixture of Indigenous-made and commercially purchased items scattered around the campsite. In front of the rightmost tent, a seated woman prepares food near a large pot while a man and child stand nearby.

The costumes worn by these Chilkat dancers at Klukwan include button-design and beaded tunics, with elaborately-beaded aprons and fringed leather shirts. The boy in the darker costume wears a wig and headdress of mountain goat horn normally reserved for the ixt, or spiritual leader. All five of the men have nose rings, a traditional adornment, but the boys do not wear them.

Tlingit women made finely-woven baskets for the tourist trade and marketed them in towns served by steamship lines. In this photo, three weavers work on baskets using spruce root and grasses, and decorated in a technique known as &quot;false embroidery.&quot; False embroidery involves using dyed grass stems wrapped around the weft so the pattern shows only on the outside of the basket. Beaded pouches, a basketry-covered flask, and a few other items are laid out on the grass in front of the women. A baby sleeps beside its mother, wrapped tightly in its cradleboard, and a glass baby bottle with a long-necked nipple sits at the cradleboard's foot.

The style of the cap appears Tlingit, but the infant's moccasins and the sling are probably of Alaskan Athabaskan origin. Around the beginning of the 20th century, white photographers used photographs of Indigenous babies on commercial products, and this image was produced on a Christmas card.

Here, men and boys dressed in dance regalia pose in front of the house of Chief Klart-Reech at Klukwan, Alaska. The man in the center, wearing the highly-patterned Chilkat tunic, is Yielgooxu, a hereditary chief of the Klukwan Whale House. The man next to him wears a fur-trimmed shirt with a beaver design. Several of the masks and spruce root hats appear in photos of the interior of the Whale House taken by the same photographer. The mixture of native and European clothing is typical of this time period.

In this photograph, a woman works on a Chilkat ceremonial dance blanket using a frame loom. Chilkat blankets are elaborate ceremonial blankets made by the Tlingit as well as neighboring peoples. They feature abstracted images of animals and are traditionally worn during important events. The warp threads, made from cedar bark covered with mountain goat wool, hang in bundles from the top bar. The weaver has completed the border on three sides and is beginning to weave the design in the center. She has carefully placed newspapers over the edges of her blanket to protect the finished portion. A closer look at the image reveals that the newspapers originated in California and are dated January 12, 1904. Traditionally, men created the designs and painted them on boards which the women used as patterns for their weaving.

    <dc:description>The Tlingit people have lived on the coast and islands of what is now southeastern Alaska since time immemorial. Tlingit society is organized into clans, which follow maternal descent. Fishing, gathering, and hunting were central to historic Tlingit lifeways – they used salmon, shellfish, seals, berries, deer, and other food sources. They used every part for different purposes, not wasting anything. The Tlingit also had many uses for cedar trees, from houses, to totems, canoes, and baskets. Canoes were one of the main modes of transport for the Tlingit and enabled them to travel and trade not only amongst each other but also with neighboring peoples north and south along the Pacific coast. 

This image shows a group of Indigenous women selling baskets, beaded clothing, and other goods near the Treadwell gold mines. The Treadwell mines were located on Douglas Island, across the channel from Juneau. The land around Juneau is the traditional home of the Auke and Taku tribes of the Tlingit people. In 1881, settlers and gold miners displaced the Auke and Taku people in order to establish the Treadwell gold mines. After the mines opened, Indigenous women came from nearby villages to sell wares to the gold miners and tourists. The baskets for sale in this photograph are Tlingit in style.

Note from unidentified source: Old Mission State Park features the oldest standing building in Idaho, The Mission of the Sacred Heart built between 1848 and 1853. Mission walls stand a foot thick, without the benefit of nails. The structure was woven carefully of straw, mud and wooden pegs. Inside, there are no pews because the Indians preferred to worship in an open room. Over 300 members of the tribe labored over the construction. It transferred in 1877 to Desmet where it stands today.

    <dc:description>Four men pose for portrait in suits; two seated, two standing.

Caption on mount: This is a deputation of Indian Chiefs that General [Oliver Otis] Howard sent back to Washington D.C. in about 1879 or 1880. The clothes they are wearing was the idea of the Army Officers that conducted them on the trip. The man at the extreme left (sitting) is Chief Moses. The tall man standing next with his right hand on the shoulder of Chief Moses is Chil-lee-leet-sah, a nephew of Chief Moses and at the time the picture was taken had been designated to be the successor of Chief Moses. The large man sitting next is an Umatilla chief named Peo-peo-mox-mox which appears to mean Flying Yellow Geese. The small man standing at the extreme right is an Umatilla or Cayuse chief named as follows: Kah-lees-quot-quo-lot. Chief Moses died late in March 1899 and Chil-lee-leet-sah was drowned in the Coulmbia river near the mouth of the Spokane river about a year before Chief Moses died. We have no record of the other two chiefs.

Note from Center for Columbia River History: 1879 delegation to Washington D.C. Left to Right, Chief Moses (Sulktalthscosum), Moses' nephew, Chillileetsah, Hiachenie of the Cayuse, and Chief Homily of the Walla Wallas.</dc:description>

Note from unidentified source: &quot;1936 Inchelium, WA. Father Pat Savage, S.J., on my two day visit to Inchelium, Pater told me to cook what I wanted. Later I learned that in my two-day visit I had consumed one month's supply of food. Fr. Savage wore roman collar, a dickey, cuffs and white tennis shoes. But he always wore a coat because he never wore a shirt.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Bird's eye view of parade at the National Indian Congress in Spokane.  There is some disagreement of source concerning whether this particular parade happened in 1925 or 1926.  At both Congresses they had colorful parades with Indians in full regalia from 28 different tribes of the Pacific Northwest.  This picture is of the Umatilla Tribe, taken in front of the Davenport Hotel, Sprague Ave.  Flags are hung over the street.</dc:description>

Note from unidentified source: Tu-Ah-Tway or 'Young Chief' as he was also known. He was a son of Allicot [Ollokot], the brother of Chief Joseph. His mother was a descendent of the famous Cayuse chief Tauitowe (as the name appears in the old histories) also called Young Chief, who was prominent in Dr. Whitman's day, also during the Cayuse War and at Gov. Stevens Walla Walla council. This man died about 1920. On account of his lineage and his personality his memory is much revered among the Umatillas and Nez Perces of the Chief Joseph strain.</dc:description>

    <dc:subject>First aid in illness and injury; Colville Indians--Health  &amp; welfare; Health education--Washington (State)--Fort   Spokane</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>This may have been some kind of test.  It was written by a 17 year old Colville girl.

List compiled by Fannie  Wynecoop entitled: What to do in case of accidents.  The   text reads:  1. For nose bleeds put ice or anything as cold  as you can get just back of the neck.  Roll a small piece of paper up and place under the upper lip.  Hold the arms as   high above the head as possible and make the patient hold   his head up.  2.  For frost bite rub snow on the injured   part and do not go near a fire or in a warm room.  3. For   sprained ankles or any other joints keep hot cloths on the   injured part and if you can't get a doctor try to get it in  place as soon as possible.  4. For sun stroke keep the head  cool the same as in nose bleeds and do not give anything   cold to drink but give something warm.  5. In case of   fainting give the patient plenty of fresh air and loosen all tight clothing, sprinkle a little cold water on face. 6. In  case of apoplexy keep the head up.  7. In case of a   hemmorage of any kind to keep quiet is the main thing.  8.   For cuts of any kind keep everything clean to avoid puss   gathering.  For a bad cut on the arm for instance bind tight with a stout string or cloth above the cut.</dc:description>

Notes from unknown source: &quot;The basketweaver. Here is Annie's Katie, a basket weaver in front of her wikiup on the beach near Everett. Katie's daughter Susie will be known as Katie's Susie. When Susie in course of time has a little daughter and her name happens to be Mary, then she'll be known as Susie's Mary, and so right down the line. A real old Indian custom.</dc:description>

Caption on image: 'Shet-a-mo-on-e'.  A noted chief of Yakimas. Copyrighted by Rutter. 1900. The Tepee is buffalo skins.

Note on verso of photograph: Shut-a-mo-ne, Sheep Cross Horns. This Indian is half Yakima and half Umatilla. His uncle was an Umatilla Chief. He served with U.S. Troops during the Bannock war of 1878, and killed the Bannock chief, and brought his head back to the camp of General Howard. He prevented the Umatillas from joining the hostiles and Bannocks in war against the whites. He dies several years ago, and at the big potlatch his war horse and nearly all his belongings were given to Shut-a-mo-ne, his nephew, he being the nearest living relative. It is the Umatilla Chief's dress that is now worn by Shut-a-mo-ne as shown in this picture.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Tlingit totem pole is unveiled at Pioneer Square, Seattle, Washington, October 18, 1899</dc:title>

</dc:creator>
    <dc:subject>Totem poles--Washington (State)--Seattle ; Tlingit Indians--Arts &amp; crafts; Pioneer Square (Seattle, Wash.); Seattle (Wash.)</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>A large crowd waits in Pioneer Square for the dedication of the totem pole, 1899. The pole stands beside an intersection, and is surrounded by people and stands for a fireworks display. Wagons, trolley car and buildings of Pioneer Square visible in background. Viewed from east. 

Caption on image: Unveiling the totem pole on Pioneer Square, Seattle, Oct 18, '99

Note from Museum of History and Industry: The totem pole at Pioneer Square has been a Seattle landmark since 1899. That year, a group of Seattle businessmen visited a Tlingit village in Alaska. They thought the village was deserted and removed a 50-foot tall  totem pole as a souvenir. The men brought the pole back to Seattle and had it set up in Pioneer Square. They were later fined for the theft of the pole. After being damaged by fire in 1938, it was replaced by a duplicate pole carved by Tlingit craftsmen.

    <dc:description>Chilkat blanket, totem poles, canoes, tools, baskets &amp; nets  on display. The Chilkat robe is said to be from Killisnoo from the gravesite of a man who had adopted to Christianity and vowed to give up old customs. The robe with &quot;Diving Whale Pattern&quot;, was donated to the museum by his family. Also pictured are two totem poles from Metlakatla that were brought to the museum in 1888 when a group of young men from Father Duncan's Christian community came to the Sitka Industrial Training School. They were about to burn the poles when Sheldon Jackson arrived to bring the young men to Sitka and asked them to spare the poles and bring them to the museum.

Note from unidentified source: In Sheldon Jackson Museum

Note on   postcard: Sept. 4, 1906. South Bend Washington. This lady   lives not far from here and today I saw some five specimens  of her work in a store downtown -- but the prices were too   high -- for me. My train is due in Seattle a little after   4-- I'll probably not reach U. Heights til six though. Hope  to find you there and alive.</dc:description>

Caption in album: Indian village on west coast of Washington in 1897. The only commercial resource of these people seems to be fish. To any but the people born and raised in them these villages are dirty...malodorous and altogether unlovely. The inhabitants, however, are more comfortable in them than they would be in Seattle or Paris.

The chief's ancestor with the double blackfish hat obtained from the Nass Tsimshian in the famed battle of the Stikine. Below the top figure is the groundhog. Note the openings in the back of the pole. These were originally used as repositories for the ashes of the deceased and the pole was a mortuary or memorial pole. Axel Ramussen says the natives always identify this as Gonaqadate.

Note on verso of NA628: Shut-a-mo-ne, Sheep Cross Horns. This Indian is half Yakima and half Umatilla. His uncle was an Umatilla Chief. He served with U.S. Troops during the Bannock war of 1878, and killed the Bannock chief, and brought his head back to the camp of General Howard. He prevented the Umatillas from joining the hostiles and Bannocks in war against the whites. He died several years ago, and at the big potlatch his war horse and nearly all his belongings were given to Shut-a-mo-ne, his nephew, he being the nearest living relative.

    <dc:description>On verso of image:  Totem at Wrangell. Picture given to Viola E. Garfield by Mrs. J.W. Young, Ketchikan 8/12/40.  This pole was owned by A. Rasmussen, Skagway. See Niblack, Coast Indians, Plate LXV, fig. 347.  The top figure is beaver and not the bear. Rasmussen says the three figures below the beaver were carved separately and nailed to the pole at a later time. It may be that there were two poles though. This is not likely.  Niblack says: &quot;Grave of Chief Shustocks on Shustock's Point, opposite Wrangell. Pole is surmounted by black bear.&quot; It is in front of a square house with a high platformed square under the roof.  Pole bought by Terr. Museum, Juneau from Rasmussen's estate - Oct. 1945.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>On verso of image:  Modern short pole, obviously posed for this photograph.  The whale at the top and Raven at the base diving under the ocean are the only certainly identifiable figures.  The cross grooves in the ears of the figures suggests a Haida carver, but the whole style is degenerate.  The mountain in the background appears to be Deer, a mountain back of Ketchikan.  If so, the pole was photographed in Saxman.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>From unidentified material:  Indian graveyard across the river from the village of Quinault (now renamed Taholah). In the large ocean-going canoe are the remains of eight brothers and sisters out of one family. When an Indian died and before the corpse was cold a rope was put under the knees and around the back of the neck by which means the body was drawn up and tied in as small a bundle as possible. All belongings of the deceased were placed in and on the grave to be used in the happy hunting grounds.

    <dc:description>Houses and totem poles.  This village of Tsahi was founded in 1840 when the tribe abandoned Kalokwis on Turnour Island in order to be near the Hudson's Bay Company post which was being established at Fort Rupert on Vancouver Island.  The totem pole in the foreground commemorates the legendary history of a Tsimshian family.  Its presence in this Kwakiutl settlement is due to the following circumstances.  A party of Seattle men, cruising in Alaska, innocently removed a totem pole from what they supposed was an abandoned village, and placed it in a public square of their city.  In reality the inhabitants of the Alaskan village were only temporarily absent, and when they returned and learned of the spoliation, there was a protest.  The news finally reached Fort Rupert where there lived a prominent member of the wronged family, the aged Tsimshian widow of a former employee of the Hudson's Bay Company.  In order to wipe out the stain on the family name, she had a local carver produce a totem pole according to her description of the lost one.  She had it erected at the house of her eldest son's eldest son.  According to Viola Garfield, the original pole was stolen from Tongass, Alaska and placed in Pioneer Square in 1899, making it of Tlingit manufacture.

    <dc:title>Tlingit totem pole in Pioneer Square seen from Yesler Street, Seattle, Washington</dc:title>
    <dc:creator>Warner, Arthur Churchill, 1864-1943
</dc:creator>
    <dc:subject>Totem poles--Washington (State)--Seattle ; Tlingit Indians--Arts &amp; crafts; Pioneer Square (Seattle, Wash.); Seattle (Wash.)</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>Totem pole set in triangular median; small wrought iron fence around pole and shrubs. Olympic Hotel (with Northern Pacific ticket office) visible behind it. Horse drawn buggy and truck seen along 1st Avenue South behind pole. Taken pre-1906, as the Pioneer Square Pergola has not been built. Also in NA1509, cur3963, cur47020, UW8571

Caption on image: The totem pole. 204.

Note from Museum of History and Industry: The totem pole at Pioneer Square has been a Seattle landmark since 1899. That year, a group of Seattle businessmen visited a Tlingit village in Alaska. They thought the village was deserted and removed a 50-foot tall  totem pole as a souvenir. The men brought the pole back to Seattle and had it set up in Pioneer Square. They were later fined for the theft of the pole. After being damaged by fire in 1938, it was replaced by a duplicate pole carved by Tlingit craftsmen.</dc:description>
