### Notes
#### Identifying Problem Terms
* From John: <br>
  _John V is going to check with Audra "I received some feedback from Audra of which you're probably aware but I need to pass along anyway. Virtually all of the ContentDM material used the term "Skitswish" to refer to the Coeur d'Alene Tribe. Audra let me know that this term is what outsiders used to refer to them. They prefer the term "Schitsuâ€™umsh" so that's an update you may want to consider implementing and use for any new metadata if you aren't already."_ 
* Term occurs on two different collections on the back end of Content - text and images
    * For images it occurs in title and there are a few instances where it appears on the item itself
    * In text portion it only occurs in the subject field
* All of the instances of the non-preferred term are contained in ContentDM
#### Remediation Plan
* "Before" data export from Content to be done by Elaine
* Titles: find and replace old term in batch
    * Can we batch upload the deprecated value field?
        * Elaine will ask Anne Graham about this   
    * Elaine will take care of title and notes field corrections
* Subjects: LCSH
    * Crystal will do the subject terms after Elaine has exported "before" snapshot
    * John will consult on appropriateness of current LCSH term and get back to group
    * Harmful term was in Wikidata, Crystal took it out today (except the reference to the see-also from LCSH, which can't really be taken out until LC gets around to changing the LCSH)
#### Follow-up Plan
* All of the text items originate from UWSC but all of the images except for one come from the Spokane museum with one from the Jesuite archives
* Crystal added an issue to send the email after we complete the project - it'll be nice to be able to point them to a publically avaiable map like with the Harriman project. Elaine volunteered to send follow-up emails
