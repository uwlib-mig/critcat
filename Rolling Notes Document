Rolling Notes Document - Native Northwest Online
Term - on the back end its two different collections text and images 
For images it occurs in title and there are a few instances where it appears on the item itself 
In the text portion it only appears in the subject field 
Term supplied by tribe - implied that we would switch the former term to new one. Not sure if we should add 'tribe' to the end. 
Note field will take a little more investigating 
For the subject fields we will need to come up with a proposal for MIG - usually we just wait for LC. 
For Pilot project it was different becuase the term was not accurate for the group that was discribed. In this case, this is the right group of people but not the preffered term. 
Crystal propses - simply remove the LCSH term entirely and add a field for subjects for wikidata and make sure the subject is set up how they want to be in Wikidata. this would be ab efficient repalcement.
There is precident or crystals proposal--when they were changeing the subject for undocumented immigrants. for this project, all we would need is some sort of a way to go back in and fix it when LCSH updates the terms
All of the instances of the non-preferred term are contained in ContentDM 
All of the text items originate from UWSC but all of the images except for one come from the Spokane museum with one from the Jesuite archives
Will need to add a to do item to send the email after we did it - itll be nice to be able to point them to a publically avaiable map like with the Harriman project
