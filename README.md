# Critical Cataloging, Archival Description, and Metadata Working Group

## Group Charge
The Critical Cataloging, Archival Description, and Metadata Working Group is made up of members from across the library interested in reparative description. It is a self selected, non-formal group within the libraries. 

The CritCat working group meets on an as-needed basis minimally meeting on a quarterly basis.  The CritCat meetings are intended for the members to report out on special projects, monitor the Feedback Form: UW Libraries Harmful Language in Descriptive Resources (Responses), and maintain the group GitHub/SharePoint presence, blog, and StaffWeb site. Meetings are organized by co-chairs.

The Co-Chairs are responsible for creating meeting agendas, updating administrative documentation on StaffWeb, and monitoring the Feedback Form: UW Libraries Harmful Language in Descriptive Resources (Responses) for new submissions. When new items are submitted to the form, the Co-Chairs will notify the working group during meetings, discuss the action plan to respond to queries, solicit volunteers to head the special project if needed, and loop in relevant parties.
WordPress will be updated at the end of each special project and annually in July, or the end of the fiscal year
StaffWeb will be updated when changes have been made to administrative documentation or personnel shifts
Meeting Minutes to be updated annually 
GitHub will be updated continuously throughout the projects

Members of the working group participate in meetings and volunteer to work on special project groups. Members will be asked to manage special projects and follow the workflow for remediating description.
