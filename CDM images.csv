Despite this attempt to enforce separation between Indigenous people and the settlers, Seattle depended on Indigenous people. Settlers relied on Native people for domestic work and for trade of fish, shellfish, and baskets. Indigenous people from across the Pacific Northwest also harvested hops in agricultural areas to the south and east of Seattle.     Because they were excluded from the rest of the city, many Indigenous people stayed on Ballast Island, either when passing through, temporarily stopping, or living on the island year-round. Ballast Island was in the harbor at the foot of Washington Street and was created when sailing ships dumped their ballast in Elliott Bay in order to take on cargo. The only place close to Seattle’s business district where Indigenous people were allowed to live, Ballast Island lacked a source of fresh water or permanent structures. As the waterfront grew in the 1890s, Ballast Island was gradually covered and by the time the seawall was built in 1916, the island was almost completely gone and its Indigenous residents had again been displaced.

Often, whole families would work together and on occasion entire villages were emptied as people left for the hops harvest. Workers would use downtime to socialize with each other, weave baskets to sell, or fish for salmon.

After the fish laid and fertilized their eggs, Quinault fishers use a wide array of nets or traps to catch them. Historically, the Quinault also hunted whales, seals, and sea lions.     In this image taken near Moclips, a group of tourists watches a Quinault canoe paddle out from the shore.

As part of this treaty, many Indigenous people agreed to move in their tribal groups to reservations outside of the Seattle area, but some remained. In 1865 the Board of Trustees of Seattle passed Ordinance No. 5 banning Indigenous people from living in the city unless they worked for a non-Indigenous resident and lived on their employer’s property.     Hwehlchtid (called Salmon Bay Charlie by the settlers) of the Shilshole people lived on the southern shore of Salmon Bay, near present-day Ballard, which was then outside of Seattle.

During his lifetime, Indigenous people were confined to live on reservations and their children were taken to boarding schools. These schools prohibited Indigenous customs or languages in an attempt to ""civilize"" Indigenous children and eradicate their culture. At the time, many people both white and Indigenous believed that Indigenous people and their cultural identities would eventually vanish completely.     William Shelton wanted to preserve his peoples’ stories and cultural values through art. Though totem poles were not traditionally made by the Indigenous peoples of Washington, he decided to adapt the form. He gathered stories from elders of multiple tribes in western Washington and began carving a 60-foot pole with figures that represented the stories. The pole also included figures called skla’letut which represent guardian spirits or supernatural powers and figures that Shelton remembered from his childhood on the Tulalip Reservation. He called the result a ""story pole."" His first story pole was carved in 1912 and installed in 1913 in front of the Tulalip Indian School. Over the rest of his life Shelton carved at least 16 additional large story poles for public display.     This image shows Shelton carving a story pole commissioned by the City of Everett. This pole was installed in 1923 and includes figures of an octopus, a man, and a frog.

In the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, these groups ceded most of their land to the United States and reserved the Tulalip Indian Reservation for their permanent homeland. They also reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. The name Tulalip comes from the Coast Salish word “dxwlilap,” meaning “small-mouth bay.”    Catholic missionaries opened a boarding school on the Tulalip reservation in 1857. After a few years, the school began receiving funding from the federal government and in 1902 the government fully took over the school. That year, the original school buildings burned down, and a new school reopened in 1905. The school had a capacity of 200 students, who were as young as six. The photographer Ferdinand Brady had a government contract in the 1910s to photograph the people and activities around the Tulalip Indian School. The Tulalip school was one of many boarding schools for Indigenous children across the US. These schools were an attempt to “civilize” Indigenous peoples by forcing their children to assimilate to white-dominated Western society. One of the primary ways the schools undertook this goal was forcing students to speak English exclusively. Severe punishment, including physical punishment, was imposed when students spoke their native languages or otherwise resisted school authorities.     Student bands at the Tulalip school date back to 1860, when the school was operated by Catholic missionaries. That year, the school had 15 students and its all-boys band played in nearby towns to raise money for the school. In 1912, members of the band included, front row, left to right: Fred Curley (Lummi); George Jones (Tulalip); and Alfred Sam (Snohomish) at far right.

In the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, these groups ceded most of their land to the United States and reserved the Tulalip Indian Reservation for their permanent homeland.

Loggers cleared most of the reservation land in the first part of the 20th century. The cut logs were hauled to the bay and floated in log booms to sawmills located throughout the area. The Tulalip Indian School also encouraged its students to become farmers, which required the clearing of forests on the reservation. Indigenous men, like the three seen here, found employment in all aspects of the lumber industry.

Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting.

They share cultural traditions and language but remain distinct nations, each with a hereditary chief. The Nuu-chah-nulth peoples were previously called the Nootka after European colonizers misunderstood their name and assumed them all to be one tribe, but they collectively chose this new name for themselves in 1978. Fishing and whaling were important parts of Nuu-chah-nulth culture, and they continue to protect their hunting and fishing rights on traditional territory. The Nuu-chah-nulth also have a tradition of skilled woodworking; they build totem poles, multifamily homes, and large oceangoing canoes. Over the 19th century, the increasing presence of settlers displaced the Nuu-chah-nulth from their historic land and they were forced onto reserves created by the Canadian government. As of 2022, the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council represents about 10,000 enrolled members across 14 First Nations on Vancouver Island.     The renowned carver Atlieu (Charlie Williams) came from a Tla-o-qui-aht village on Vancouver Island but lived part of the time with the Makah in Neah Bay, Washington.

The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting.     Makah women have a tradition of basketry back to time immemorial. They use grasses, tree bark, or roots to make a variety of baskets and mats for various uses. Some Makah baskets are so tightly woven that they are watertight. Today, the tradition is carried on by both women and men. This photo, taken sometime between about 1900 and 1910, shows a Makah basketmaker on the beach, probably at Port Townsend. She is using cedar bark strips to make a dry storage container.     The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

The Coast Salish style of canoe was more lightly constructed than other canoes built by Indigenous peoples and was not suited for longer voyages or in rough waters. It was also not as useful for fishing, carrying cargo, or raiding and as a result the style was gradually replaced by the more robust West Coast style of canoe, originally built by the Nuu-Chah-Nulth of Vancouver Island.

As a result, West Coast style canoes became the most common style in the Pacific Northwest during the late 19th century.     The photographer, James McCurdy, was born in Port Townsend in 1872. He spent many years of his childhood in Neah Bay on the Makah reservation and returned to Port Townsend in 1894.

They made dugout canoes which they used to navigate the river and reach Puget Sound. Traditionally the Snoqualmie burned off the bottom lands of the Snoqualmie Valley to create open areas that ensured an abundance of edible plants for foraging as well as supplied space for game animals to feed. In the early 19th century, the Snoqualmie were among the most powerful tribes around Puget Sound. They exerted economic influence over neighboring groups from Whidbey Island to Snoqualmie Pass. The Snoqualmie signed the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, ceding their land to the United States. They were temporarily assigned to live on the Tulalip reservation and were promised a reservation of their own. However, the US government reneged on its promise and no land was allocated for the Snoqualmie, most of whom moved back to their historic lands or stayed on the Tulalip reservation. The Snoqualmie finally received a reservation on their historic land in 1999.    This image is a portrait of Patkanim (or Pat Kanim), the chief of the Snoqualmie and Snohomish in the mid 19th century. In the 1840s, he wanted to force out the early white settlers. However, after visiting San Francisco in 1850, Patkanim decided that any fight against the settlers would be hopeless. He signed the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855 and aided the settlers against other Indigenous groups in the war of 1855-1856. Patkanim died in 1858 on the Tulalip Reservation.

They call themselves ""Spuyalepabs"" in their native language of Lushootseed, meaning ""people from the bend at the bottom of the river."" Before settlers arrived, the Puyallup lived in villages that spread from the Cascade foothills to the shores of Puget Sound. In 1854, Puyallup leaders signed the Medicine Creek Treaty under duress. The Puyallup ceded most of their land to the US in this treaty, but due to US government treaty violations in the size and location of reservations, the Puyallup peoples joined what is now called the Puget Sound War in 1855-1856. After the war ended, the treaty was renegotiated and the Puyallup reservation was enlarged. Since then, the Puyallup have fought for tribal rights, including in the fish wars of the 1960s and 70s and the Puyallup Land Claims Settlement in 1990.    Starting in the middle of the 19th century, church groups and the United States government set up boarding schools for Indigenous children. Here, children from many tribes were taught to speak English and were educated with a focus on agriculture and manual skills. They were separated from their elders, discouraged from learning their tribal traditions, and punished for speaking languages other than English.

The Steilacoom consisted of five bands: Steilacoom, Sastuck, Spanaway, Tilhlow, and Segwallitchew. Unlike many of their neighbors the Steilacoom did not live near a glacier-fed river, but on land featuring a group of lakes and creeks. The Steilacoom were affected by settlers earlier than most other Indigenous peoples in Washington. Settlers encroached on their land starting in the 1830s, and the first incorporated town north of the Columbia River was in Steilacoom territory. In 1854, Steilacoom leaders signed the Medicine Creek Treaty and ceded their land to the United States. The US government expected Steilacoom land to be heavily populated with settlers and so did not assign the Steilacoom a reservation. Instead, the Steilacoom were assigned to live on neighboring reservations. Many refused to leave, however, and have remained on their historic lands. The Steilacoom Tribe is not federally recognized.     Steilacoom John was a leader of the Steilacoom Tribe and a son of Ce-col-quin, a signer of the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty. In this photograph, John and his wife Goe-lit-sah (also called Anna or Annie) are seated in front of their home with a basket and other household items.

The Quileute are not related to either the Makah to the north or the Coast Salish peoples of western Washington, and the Quileute language is unrelated to any other in the world. Quileute land is directly exposed to the Pacific Ocean and receives about 9.5 feet of average yearly rainfall. To protect themselves, the Quileute made rainproof hats and clothing using the inner layer of cedar bark. The Quileute signed the Treaty of Olympia in 1856, in which they ceded their land and agreed to move to a reservation. In the treaty, the Quileute reserved rights for hunting, fishing, and gathering at all usual and accustomed places. However, because their land was so remote, reservations were not established until 1889 and 1893. Today, most Quileutes live on either the Quileute or the Hoh reservations.    Because Quileute land was distant from road or rail connections, the Quileute obtained supplies by loading up their large sea-going canoes. In this photo, a group unloads large sacks at First Beach, which borders the village of La Push. The canoes are of the West Coast style with an upturned prow and a vertical stern.

This seasonal work gave them a chance to earn the money they needed to buy things in a cash economy.     Many Native families traveled to the hop fields where they camped out during the harvest. Some returned to the same hop fields each year, and this became an important social event. Schools were closed during the harvest so that children could help in the fields.

They also lived on Whidbey Island and on the south shore of Vancouver Island. The S’Klallam lived in permanent longhouses during the winter, but in other seasons individual families spread out and camped at traditional sites to fish, hunt, or gather resources. In 1855, the S’Klallam signed the Point No Point Treaty and ceded their land to the United States but reserved rights to hunt, fish, and gather at usual and accustomed sites. The treaty stated that the S’Klallam would move to a reservation at Skokomish, but this site was distant from their traditional lands and most S’Klallams refused to leave. Beginning in the 1870s, many S’Klallam individuals privately purchased land on their traditional territory. As a result, separate S’Klallam groups emerged, which last to this day. One of the tribes lives on Vancouver Island at Becher Bay. The other three are on the northern Olympic Peninsula – the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (federally recognized in 1939), the Port Gamble S’Klallam Tribe (federally recognized in 1936), and the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe (federally recognized in 1981).    This is a portrait of Chits-A-Man-Han (nicknamed the “Duke of York” by the settlers) and his wife. He was chief of the S’Klallam in the 1850s and was one of the signers of the Point No Point Treaty.

During the winter, they lived in permanent villages built on the valley floor, where the climate was most temperate. Starting in spring, they traveled along the rivers and into the hills to gather food. Some gathered roots and berries, and others fished in rivers, especially the Columbia and the Yakima. In 1855, a confederation of 14 tribal groups signed the Yakama Nation Treaty with the United States and ceded most of their traditional lands, but reserved rights for hunting, gathering, and fishing at all usual and accustomed places. These groups were: Kah-miltpah, Palouse, Klickitat, See-ap-Cat, Klinquit, Sk-in-pah, Li-ay-was, Oche-Chotes, Wenatchapam, Pesquose, Yakama, Shyiks, Know-was-say-ee, and Wish-ham. All 14 groups are now part of the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation and live on a reservation in central Washington.     This image taken by a Yakima-area photographer, shows a Yakama man identified as Captain Billy and a woman whose name is unknown, possibly his wife. Captain Billy wears animal skin decorations in his hair, and the woman carries a cornhusk bag on her horse's saddle. Both horses wear feathers on their bridles. Writing on the image describes the woman as a """"squaw."""" This word is a sexist and racist slur used to refer to Indigenous North American women.

In 1855, the Klickitat signed a treaty ceding their land to the United States while reserving rights to fish, hunt, and gather at all usual and accustomed places.

They were in an advantageous position between the coast and the Great Plains, allowing them to trade between both. The Cayuse owned horses in large numbers, which led to their expansion and brought them into contact with tribes on the coast as well as further inland. In 1855, the Cayuse in confederation with the Walla Walla and the Umatilla peoples signed a treaty with the United States. The tribes ceded their land but reserved rights to hunt, fish, and gather at usual and accustomed places. They also reserved the Umatilla Indian Reservation as a permanent homeland. Today, most Cayuse live on the Umatilla Indian Reservation.     In this photo, Cayuse twins Tax-a-Lax and Alompum (Emma and Edna Jones) look out from their undecorated wood and fabric cradleboards. One source identifies the twins as grandnieces of Chief Joseph, a leader of the Nez Perce people. Various tribes in interior Washington and Oregon traditionally wrapped their infants tightly and laced them into cradleboards. Cradleboards were often made of wood, with a covering of leather or fabric. Some were quite plain while others were highly decorated with beadwork and shells. Women would carry cradleboards in their arms or on their backs, so they could care for infants while performing other tasks.     From 1889 to 1891, photographer Lee Moorhouse served as “Indian Agent” on the Umatilla Reservation, and many of his subjects were members of the Umatilla, Cayuse, and Walla Walla tribes.

One of their largest and most important sites was Tr’ochëk, where the Klondike and Yukon Rivers meet. It was there that the Klondike Gold Rush started in 1896 and within a few years thousands of people had come to Hän lands hoping to find gold. The prospectors drove game animals away and took over the land, which threatened the Hän people's traditional lifeways. Chief Isaac of the Hän people, shown here, saw the impacts that the Gold Rush had on his people and their culture. In response, he moved them three miles downriver to Moosehide and entrusted knowledge of many of their songs and dances to Indigenous people in Alaska for safekeeping. In the aftermath of the gold rush, the Hän strove to balance Indigenous traditions against cultural influences from the settlers. Chief Isaac continued to lead the Hän until his death in 1932. Today, most Hän people are part of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation in Dawson City. The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in began negotiating their Land Claim in 1991 and it came into effect in 1998.

"Swinomish drummer and singer at the Treaty Day observance, January 22, 1939",,Seattle Post-Intelligencer,United States--Washington (State)--Seattle,,1939,1939,1939,"The Swinomish are a Coast Salish group whose historic lands were in the Skagit and Samish River valleys as well as Whidbey, Camano, Fidalgo Islands, and the San Juan Islands. They lived in large permanent villages during the winter, then spread out in spring and summer to gather resources – salmon from the rivers, shellfish from the coastline, cedar wood and berries from inland forests. In 1855, a confederation of four major groups and their allied bands – Aboriginal Swinomish, Lower Skagit, Kikiallus, and Aboriginal Samish – signed the Treaty of Point Elliott with the United States. They ceded their land to the US while reserving rights to hunt, fish, and gather at usual and accustomed places, as well as reserving the Swinomish Reservation on southeastern Fidalgo Island for a permanent homeland. Today, most descendants of these groups live on the Swinomish Reservation.     On January 22, 1939, the tribes living at the Swinomish Reservation near La Conner, Washington, held their annual Treaty Day observance. The event marked the anniversary of the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott. In addition to the tribes from the Swinomish Reservation, tribal members from the Saanich and Cowichan (in British Columbia) and from the Puyallup came to the celebration. Treaty Day events included feasting, singing, drumming, and dancing. The 1939 Treaty Day was the first year that Swinomish chiefs allowed the ceremonies to be photographed.

He also wanted to use publicity from the race to build economic ties to the settler communities around the reservation. The two canoes participating in the race were named 'Lone Eagle' and 'Susie Q.'

"Indigenous berry pickers on Vashon Island, June 1943",,Seattle Post-Intelligencer,United States--Washington (State)--Seattle,,1943,1943,1943,"The United States' entry into World War II in December 1941 created labor shortages as many men left civilian jobs to join the military. On the West Coast, the shortage was exacerbated by the forced removal of Japanese Americans, many of whom were farmers. In the summer of 1943, the Vashon Island Packing Company hired 80 First Nations people from British Columbia to weed and harvest strawberries, loganberries, and currants. The Indigenous workers replaced Filipino workers who were now growing vegetables and working in war industries. The First Nations farmworkers earned 50 to 60 cents an hour, reportedly two to three times what they might have made at home. Those who stayed the whole summer had their transportation to and from Canada paid for as well. Under the 18th century Jay Treaty between Britain and the United States, Indigenous people could freely cross the US-Canada border by proving their tribal status. First Nations people had begun working on Bainbridge and Vashon Islands as fruit pickers in the early 1900s. Most of them were women, because men from their tribes stayed closer to home to work as loggers or dockworkers.

The early Makah were skilled mariners, using several types of canoes which they carved from western red cedar for various purposes—war, whaling, fishing, sealing, carrying cargo, and long voyages. Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting.     In August of each year the Makah people hold the annual Makah Days celebration at Neah Bay, which celebrates the Makah people gaining full US citizenship in 1924. In their 1945 festival, the Makah also celebrated the end of World War II, the imminent return of 45 tribal members serving in the military, and the dedication of a new housing project on the reservation.

William Holmes Wilcox became interested in photography soon after settling in Tacoma in 1890.  He moved to Port Townsend, on the Olympic Peninsula, in 1897, where he worked for the customs service and frequently went on photographic trips with local banker/photographer James McCurdy.  Wilcox moved to California in 1916 but returned to the Pacific Northwest in 1924.  He died in 1940.  (Bob Cole, ""William Holmes Wilcox: Amateur Photographer as Artist.""

"Makah dancing at Colman Dock, Seattle, March 22, 1941",,Seattle Post-Intelligencer,United States--Washington (State)--Seattle,,1941,1941,1941,"The Makah people of the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula refer to themselves as Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx, which translates roughly to ""the people who live by the rocks and seagulls."" The early Makah were skilled mariners, using several types of canoes which they carved from western red cedar for various purposes—war, whaling, fishing, sealing, carrying cargo, and long voyages. Today, roughly 1400 Makah live in and around their traditional lands near Neah Bay on the Makah Indian Reservation. The carving of their skilled woodworkers can range in size from tiny masks to totems and giant, oceangoing canoes. Whaling and fishing have been central to Makah culture for thousands of years. The Makah are the only tribe to be granted whaling rights by treaty with the US government, in the Treaty of Neah Bay signed in 1855. While the Makah voluntarily suspended whale hunting in the 1920s due to the near extinction of whales from commercial whaling, they exercised their treaty right to hunt whales once in 1999 before court decisions blocked further legal hunting.     Here five members of the Makah tribe gave a preview of their upcoming dance performance upon arriving at Colman Dock on March 22, 1941. Charlie Swan (at right, with mask), his wife, and his daughter Delores are shown with Alexander Green (playing the drum) and his wife. The group came to Seattle to attend a Chamber of Commerce luncheon promoting tourism to the Olympic Peninsula. Charlie (also spelled Charley) Swan was a chief of the Makah. He was well known for his dancing, and had a dance troupe which gave performances throughout the Pacific Northwest.

They made dugout canoes which they used to navigate the river and reach Puget Sound. Traditionally the Snoqualmie burned off the bottom lands of the Snoqualmie Valley to create open areas that ensured an abundance of edible plants for foraging as well as supplied space for game animals to feed. In the early 19th century, the Snoqualmie were among the most powerful tribes around Puget Sound. They exerted economic influence over neighboring groups from Whidbey Island to Snoqualmie Pass. Snoqualmie chief Patkanim (also spelled Pat Kanim) signed the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, ceding the Snoqualmie people’s land to the United States. They were temporarily assigned to live on the Tulalip reservation and were promised a reservation of their own. However, the US government reneged on its promise and no land was allocated for the Snoqualmie, most of whom moved back to their historic lands or stayed on the Tulalip reservation. The Snoqualmie finally received a reservation on their historic land in 1999.    This image shows Snoqualmie chief Jerry Kanim (the nephew of Patkanim) with some of his family members. On February 21, 1948, Jerry Kanim and representatives of several other tribes met at Eagles Hall in Carnation, Washington, on historic Snoqualmie land to discuss ways of pressing their claims to the reservation land that had been promised to them.

Muckleshoot ancestors lived in villages that were tied together by marriage bonds, trade, shared ceremonies, and use of the same land. This network of interconnected villages extended far beyond the Upper Puyallup and Duwamish tribes, which allowed Muckleshoot ancestors to fish, hunt, and gather across a large area, from the west side of Puget Sound to the Cascade Mountains. The Upper Puyallup and Duwamish tribes signed treaties in 1854 and 1855 respectively, which ceded their land to the United States in exchange for reserving rights to hunt, fish, and gather at usual and accustomed places. The tribes were also promised reservations as permanent homelands. A conflict between the settlers and several Indigenous groups, now called the Puget Sound War, occurred from 1855-56 and in its aftermath a reservation was established on a plain called Muckleshoot at the junction of the White and Green Rivers. After the Muckleshoot Reservation was established, its people gradually came to be known as the Muckleshoot Tribe, instead of by their historical tribal affiliations. Since the early 20th century, the Muckleshoot people have defended their treaty rights, especially fishing rights.     Salmon was historically a mainstay food for the Indigenous tribes of the Pacific Northwest and has remained an important part of their diet. The catching, preparing, and cooking of salmon also remain significant parts of the culture of many Indigenous peoples in Washington. In this photo, several women on the Muckleshoot Reservation help prepare salmon, which has been cut and strung onto sticks and then suspended over an open fire to grill. The wood is probably alder, which gives a distinctive flavor to fresh-cooked salmon and was the preferred fuel.

Tlingit society is organized into clans, which follow maternal descent. Fishing, gathering, and hunting were central to historic Tlingit lifeways – they used salmon, shellfish, seals, berries, deer, and other food sources. They used every part for different purposes, not wasting anything. The Tlingit also had many uses for cedar trees, from houses, to totems, canoes, and baskets. Canoes were one of the main modes of transport for the Tlingit and enabled them to travel and trade not only amongst each other but also with neighboring peoples north and south along the Pacific coast.     This image shows a group of Indigenous women selling baskets, beaded clothing, and other goods near the Treadwell gold mines. The Treadwell mines were located on Douglas Island, across the channel from Juneau. The land around Juneau is the traditional home of the Auke and Taku tribes of the Tlingit people. In 1881, settlers and gold miners displaced the Auke and Taku people in order to establish the Treadwell gold mines. After the mines opened, Indigenous women came from nearby villages to sell wares to the gold miners and tourists. The baskets for sale in this photograph are Tlingit in style.

Roll a small piece of paper up and place under the upper lip.  Hold the arms as   high above the head as possible and make the patient hold   his head up.  2.  For frost bite rub snow on the injured   part and do not go near a fire or in a warm room.  3. For   sprained ankles or any other joints keep hot cloths on the   injured part and if you can't get a doctor try to get it in  place as soon as possible.  4. For sun stroke keep the head  cool the same as in nose bleeds and do not give anything   cold to drink but give something warm.  5. In case of   fainting give the patient plenty of fresh air and loosen all tight clothing, sprinkle a little cold water on face. 6. In  case of apoplexy keep the head up.  7. In case of a   hemmorage of any kind to keep quiet is the main thing.  8.   For cuts of any kind keep everything clean to avoid puss   gathering.

When an Indian died and before the corpse was cold a rope was put under the knees and around the back of the neck by which means the body was drawn up and tied in as small a bundle as possible. All belongings of the deceased were placed in and on the grave to be used in the happy hunting grounds.

"Kwakiutl village at Fort Rupert, British Columbia, 1914","Curtis, Edward S., 1868-1952",,,,1914,1914,1914,"Houses and totem poles.  This village of Tsahi was founded in 1840 when the tribe abandoned Kalokwis on Turnour Island in order to be near the Hudson's Bay Company post which was being established at Fort Rupert on Vancouver Island.  The totem pole in the foreground commemorates the legendary history of a Tsimshian family.  Its presence in this Kwakiutl settlement is due to the following circumstances.  A party of Seattle men, cruising in Alaska, innocently removed a totem pole from what they supposed was an abandoned village, and placed it in a public square of their city.  In reality the inhabitants of the Alaskan village were only temporarily absent, and when they returned and learned of the spoliation, there was a protest.  The news finally reached Fort Rupert where there lived a prominent member of the wronged family, the aged Tsimshian widow of a former employee of the Hudson's Bay Company.  In order to wipe out the stain on the family name, she had a local carver produce a totem pole according to her description of the lost one.  She had it erected at the house of her eldest son's eldest son.  According to Viola Garfield, the original pole was stolen from Tongass, Alaska and placed in Pioneer Square in 1899, making it of Tlingit manufacture.
