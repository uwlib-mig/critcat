# Best Practices
***Best Practices for CritCat Metadata Remediation Projects***  

## Project Prioritization and Advocacy
- Prioritize feedback from communities impacted by harmful language in metadata descriptions
- Practice transparency in communicating with stakeholders, including the staff or users requesting work
- Reparative metadata work requires a significant investment of staff time and resources; limitations on resources mean that it may take longer than anticipated to complete remediation projects

## Project Management Roles and Resources
- The Critical Cataloging, Archival Description, and Metadata Working Group (CritCat):
    - Acts as a clearinghouse for remediation requests
    - Performs high-level coordination for ongoing projects
    - Chair(s) assemble individual project working groups
    - Contact the CritCat group via email at [uwlib-critcat@uw.edu](mailto:uwlib-critcat@uw.edu)
- Individual project working groups:
    - Include a designated project manager
    - Include staff needed to approve and perform metadata edits in the projectâ€™s target platforms and formats. 
- The [CritCat GitHub Repository](https://github.com/uwlib-mig/critcat):
    - Is used to share project documentation and details, which are published in individual project folders
    - Is used for project management tasks including opening and tracking work in issues and project boards
    - Each project should use the [CritCat Remediation Project Checklist](checklist.md)

## Proposed Best Practices for Metadata Remediation
- Seek input from relevant staff, community stakeholders, and/or subject experts when constructing new metadata values. This includes new metadata for physical resources held at our institution and digital surrogates. In cases where physical resources used to create digital surrogates are not held at UW, make a good faith effort to communicate with staff at the holding institution(s).
- Sometimes harmful descriptive metadata content is integral to understanding a resource in context. Where harmful language in metadata is transcribed from a physical resource and is important to understanding it, preserve this language alongside a boilerplate statement on harmful language in descriptive metadata for the collection or platform, and/or a contextual note.
- Where overlap exists, descriptive metadata for physical resources and corresponding digital resources should align. For example, the finding aid for an archival collection may include links to digital objects. The text of these links is item titles; where item titles change in the digital collection, corresponding text in the finding aid should also change.
- Record deprecated metadata values or otherwise track changes to metadata values where possible.
- Publish a summary of work performed at the [uwlib-mig/critcat repository](README.md), on the [UW Libraries Critical Cataloging, Archival Description, and Metadata blog](https://sites.uw.edu/uwlcritcat/), and/or elsewhere.
